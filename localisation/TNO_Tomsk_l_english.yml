 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BORIS_PASTERNAK_DESC:0 "보리스 레오니도비치 파스테르나크는 직업상 정치인보다는 차라리 시인이자 학자에 가깝습니다. 유대인 조상을 둔 모스크바 사람인 그는 소비에트 연방 수립 초기에 수집한 시와 영어와 독일어 고전 시집을 번역한 일로 빠르게 유명세를 얻었습니다. 하지만 초창기 그가 지향했던 레닌에 대한 찬양은 빠르게 지쳐갔고, 얼마 지나지 않아 친구들과 동료들을 블랙리스트와 감옥에서 꺼내기 위한 노력을 개시했습니다. 파스테르나크는 명성을 잃어버렸음에도 불구하고 어떤 공식적인 견책이나 박해에 직면한 적이 없었는데, 정계와 NKVD 내부에서 그가 너무 수동적이고 현실 정치에서 떨어졌다는 판단이 퍼져 있었기 때문이었습니다. 독일이 모스크바로 진군해 오면서 파르테르나크를 위시한 여타 소련 인텔리겐치아들은 동쪽으로 도망쳤고 그 중 대다수가 톰스크 시에서 거처를 찾았습니다. 거기서 그들은 불멸의 러시아 민주주의 사상에 영감을 얻어 자유주의 헌법 초안을 작성하고 소비에트 치하에서 억압당했던 표현의 자유를 부활시키기로 결정했습니다. 그들은 힘을 합쳐 극동 소비에트국 독재주의에 실질적으로 저항할 수 있는 중앙 시베리아 공화국을 탄생시켰지만, 얼마 지나지 않아 자기네 내부 군부의 야망을 제어하는데 실패하면서 제 발에 걸려 넘어져 버렸습니다.\n\n현재 파스테르나크는 지식인과 예술가가 지배하고 사상가와 시인으로 가득 찬 국가를 통치합니다. 그와 동료들이 환상적인 연설 능력과 매혹적으로 읽히는 법률 초안, 그리고 아름다운 축가들을 선사했다고는 하지만 그들의 유일한 경험은 대학 강단을 넘어서지 못합니다. 파스테르나크와 몽상가들의 국가가 어떤 의미 있는 성취를 거둘지, 아니면 자기들이 앉아 있는 진리의 상아탑에 만족하고 말 것인지는 여전히 결정되지 않은 채 의문에 싸여 있습니다."

 POLITICS_DMITRI_SHOSTAKOVICH_DESC:0 "여느 교향곡과 마찬가지로 쇼스타코비치의 새로운 삶도 한 전보알림 소리로 시작되었습니다. 요란한 전보소리가 급작스럽게 멈추었고, 작은 종이조각이 간결하고 암울한 소식을 전했습니다. 레닌그라드가 나지의 손에 떨어졌다. 그는 톰스크에서 오랜 친구를 기리기 위한 연회에 참석 중이었습니다. 집을 잃고 서쪽으로 가는 운송수단이 끊겨 도시에 갇혀버린 쇼스타코비치는 별난 평판을 가진 작곡가로서 중앙 시베리아 공화국에서 살아갔습니다.\n\n이렇게 쇼스타코비치 인생의 라그리시모(Larghissimo)가 시작되었습니다. 느리고 무거운 발걸음으로 공화국을 돌아다니는 동안 거의 아무런 특별한 일도 겪지 않은 쇼스타코비치는 그의 본업인 작곡으로 복귀해서 공화국을 미묘하게 비판하는 곡들을 썼고 톰스크 문화의 일부가 되었습니다. 그가 휴머니즘 단체에서 두각을 나타내기 시작했을 때 그의 인생은 안단테(Andante)에 접어들었습니다.\n\n하지만 이런 안정적인 템포는 그리 오래가지 못했습니다. 노보시비르스크는 징병제에 관한 의견차이로  스스로 떨어져 나갔고 구 공화국은 반란으로 갈기갈기 찢어졌습니다. 무정부주의자들이 칸스크에서 봉기하고 장군진들이 크라스노야르스크에서 반란을 일으키는 혼란스러운 상황에서 2악장이 시작되었습니다. 대단원은 공화국의 이상이 살아남아 자리잡은 톰스크에 남아 있습니다.중앙 시베리아의 대지는 새로운 극이 펼쳐지는 광경을 목격할 것입니다. 선거에서 승리한 쇼스타코비치가 이제 지휘를 시작할 것입니다. 세계는 그의 승리가 단순히 서곡에 불과한 것인지 아니면 아름다운 마무리인지 알기위해 지켜보고 있습니다.\n\n"
 
 POLITICS_DANIIL_KHARMS_DESC:0 "다닐 하름스의 본명은 다닐 이바노비치 유바쵸프이며 필명을 사용중인 그는 사람들이 일반적으로 생각하는 지도자상은 아닙니다. 전간기 동안 하름스는 레닌그라드 아방가르드 운동의 충실한 일꾼으로서의 제한적인 인지도를 지녔을 뿐이었습니다. 원래 아동문학 작가로 알려진 하름스는 또한 부조리극을 다양하게 집필하여 반체제 인사들의 호평을 받고 혁명정부 지배층들을 끊임없이 짜증나게 만들었습니다. 그의 경력은 1941년에 체포되어 레닌그라드의 정신병동에 수감된 기간 동안 잠시 중단되었고, 이어진 봉쇄로 인해 동정심 많은 간수의 호의가 없었다면 하름스는 그곳에서 죽었을지도 모릅니다. 부조리극 작가에게 일어난 부조리한 기적이었습니다.\n\n 그 당시 하름스가 바스틸라드에 빠졌다는 것은 그의 작품에 익숙하지 않은 사람들에겐 놀라운 일입니다. 그는 거칠고 갑작스러운 욕망의 승화, 짐승 같은 야만성에 의해 타락해버린 세상에서 인간으로 남아있는 것의 중요성 등 자신의 이데올로기적 특성을 은유와 다양한 문학적 장치를 이용하여 분명히 하였습니다. 하름스는 법과 질서를 이끌 가장 정통한 사람은 아닐지도 모릅니다. 하지만 요즘 같은 시대에 정통성이 뭐가 중요하겠습니까? "

 POLITICS_ANDREY_SAKHAROV_DESC:0 "한 학자는 “진실은 결코 단순하지 않다”라고 말했습니다. 그 말은 한 사람은 당연하게도 안드레이 드미트리예비치 사하로프로 복잡한 시대를 살아가는 복잡한 인간입니다. 지식 계급에서 태어난 사하로프는 소비에트 과학의 부유한 울타리 안의 정치에서 벗어난 피난처를 찾았습니다. 때때로 당에서 승인한 학회에 반하는 노골적인 발언을 통해 당국의 달갑지 않은 관심을 끌었음에도 불구하고 머리를 숙인채 자신의 연구에 몰두한 그는 살아남았습니다.\n\n사하로프는 볼셰비키 정권이 무너진 뒤 겨우 동쪽으로 탈출하여 톰스크에 거처를 마련했습니다. 그의 기술주의적이고 이상주의적인 관점은 훗날 모더니스트라고 알려질 파벌로 불러들였습니다. 과학과 기술이 더 좋은 사회를 만드는 바탕이 된다는 확고한 믿음가진 안드레이 사하로프는 그 누구와도 다른 톰스크의 이상주의를 대변합니다."
 
 POLITICS_DMITRY_LIKHACHYOV_DESC:0 "러시아의 모든 문화적 거장들 중에서, 데카브리스트들에게 드미트리 세르게예비치 리카초프보다 더 좋은 선택지는 없었습니다. 유럽 러시아의 적자로서, 리카초프의 문학에 대한 열정은 레닌그라드 국립대학교에 입학한 16세의 어린 나이에 그의 직업이 되었습니다. 리카초프는 1928년 한 문학 동아리에 연루되었다는 혐의로 비밀경찰에게 체포되어 재판도 없이 솔로베츠키 제도의 굴라그로 5년간 유배되었습니다. 그는 가까스로 처형을 피했으며, 거의 10년 뒤에는 가족을 따라 독일군의 포위망을 뚫고 레닌그라드 봉쇄에서도 살아남은 극소수의 행운아들중 하나입니다.\n\n전쟁이 끝난 후 톰스크에서 다시 나타난 그는 파스테르나크의 헌신적인 친구이자 추종자가 되었습니다. 얼마 뒤 그는 데카브리스트에 가입하였고, 늙은 시인의 죽음으로 인해 리카초프는 그들의 실질적인 수장이 되었습니다. 그는 문화유산과 역사, 다양성을 자랑하는 유럽 러시아의 비전을 포용하며, 톰스크가 조국을 평화롭고 문화가 융성하며 서방과 우호적인 황금기로 이끄는 것을 볼 것입니다."

 ERS_White_Duma_desc:0 "The modern Decembrist Society, like its ancient forebears, has long looked to the west for constitutional developments. Popularly elected legislatures are too easily swayed by populism and demagoguery, whereas appointed legislatures are callous and distant from the common man.\n\nAs such, the Decembrists have modelled their Duma on a Bicameral model.\n\nA lower house elected by the people is able to propose laws that are then analysed by an appointed upper house. The upper house's powers are constrained, and its members are some of the Republic's most respected citizens, from all political origins."

 ERS_Violet_Duma:0 "§h자색 두마§!"
 ERS_Violet_Duma_desc:0 "It is the Humanist society's most ardently held belief that the common citizens must be invested directly in politics. The Republic's legislature must thus be unicameral, and its members must be elected proportionally from a college of candidates sent on by the nation's communes, unions and citizen groups.\n\nReferendums and direct democracy are the order of the day, with coalitions of members of the Duma lasting only as long as the people support their efforts through frequent political consultations. The democratic process is set to distil the population's will!"

 ERS_Blue_Duma:0 "§m청색 두마§!"
 ERS_Blue_Duma_desc:0 "The rise of technocracy and meritocracy has increasingly clashed the will of the population with the will of entrenched bureaucratic interest. The Modernist Society seeks to preempt this threat to the Republic's foundation by combining meritocratic postings with popular mandates.\n\nAn apolitical electoral committee will design examinations for the various ranks of bureaucracy within each ministry. The best and most capable layer of candidates will be given the right to run for political offices, and present their projects to the people. This Duma of experienced public servants will work hard to fulfill their pledge to the electorate!"

 ERS_Grey_Duma:0 "§s회색 두마§!"
 ERS_Grey_Duma_desc:0 "The Bastillards have long held as their thesis that the excesses of the French Revolution, and of all ensuing failing democracies, can be directly liked to the populist platform given by an elected legislature holding all the cards. As such, their constitution has designed a Duma where the traditional bicameral legislature is flipped on its head.\n\nElected officials representing the people's will serve in a lower house whose duty is the analysis of laws proposed by the upper house.\n\nLaws carefully designed by dispassionate experts in the upper house may live or die under the public's scrutiny.\n\nBut never shall the Bastillard allow populists to introduce their poison into the Republic's bloodstream."

The citizens of the republic are divided, and it remains to be seen if the Decembrist' platform of respect for tradition and rural democracy will triumph over the Bastillard and Modernist's ideas of urban industrial renewal. Or perhaps the Humanist society's social democratic platform of decentralised democracy and investment into the people will clinch the debate?"

 ERS_the_whispers_of_camaradery:0 "The Whispers of Camaraderie"

Let them complain! The Decembrist society knows that Russians throughout the ages have embraced new ideas and new ways of doing things, and that the state need not browbeat the people into submission."

 ERS_a_walk_in_the_forest:0 "A Walk in the Forest"
 ERS_a_walk_in_the_forest_desc:0 "Critical to the Decembrist Society's view of Russian development is Russia herself. A land of forests and plains, settled by hard working men and women. An archipelago of communities out in the endless green sea of the Siberian forest.\n\nSuch a land produces hardy folks. Yet it also creates endless cultural exchange. Between the west, between the east. Russia is a melting pot, a place where ideas are traded and where the people slowly incorporate new ways of doing things into their life.\n\nTo take a walk in the forests of Tomsk is to see why the Decembrists must lead the Republic. Only the Decembrist Society and Dmitry Likhachyov understand how Russia came to be, and how it shall continue to evolve."

 ERS_the_tammering_of_machinery:0 "The Stammering of Machinery"
 ERS_the_tammering_of_machinery_desc:0 "A lot of the Republic's population lives in cities, and a lot more citizens arrive in our great urban centers every week. The staccato noise of industry punctuates the ebb and flow of workers going to and fro great colossuses of steel and smoke. The work of urban industrial workers is no less noble than the work their forebears did in the countryside. After all, hard work is eternal, and its applications limitless.\n\nThe Modernist and Bastillard societies, alike in some aspects yet dissimilar in others, have both made the life of urban workers the main issue of their respective campaigns. The Bastillards see in the urban masses a permanent dagger to the heart of the republic, and claim that a strong state is necessary to defend the republic. The Modernists see in the new industrial class the crucible in which the future of Russia is to be forged, and seek to form a government capable of harnessing this opportunity.\n\nBoth parties urge the citizens to make urban renewal the core concern of the republic's new government."

Yet valor and a great number of men under arms are nothing without modern equipment and strong supply lines. It is thus among the Modernist society's driving doctrines that the nation's strong industrial core must be used to arm a strong army, capable of defeating any regional rival."

 ERS_the_clammering_of_the_factory:0 "The Clamoring of the Factory"
 ERS_the_clammering_of_the_factory_desc:0 "The Bastillard society is wise to the ways in which populists and demagogues can bring forth the destruction of a once proud nation state. The mass industrialization of Tomsk has accumulated powers in the cities of the republic, and surrounded the offices of state with clamoring masses, easily roused from their apathy by anti-social forces.\n\nThe Bastillard society thus favors a policy of prudent economic development, squarely aimed at keeping the citizens content and confident in the state. Having thus excised mass hysteria from politics, the Republic under the presidency of Daniil Kharms and his associates from the trinity group will flourish into a new age of strength and progress."

The arts and culture are the backbones of history; where progress is actually made. The people of Tomsk deserve to enjoy the benefits of the arts and live whole and satisfying lives. People are not meant to merely survive, they are meant to thrive.\n\nThat is why the Humanist society believes in the dreams of the republic's citizens, to master their instruments, the pen, and the brush. The Humanists desire to invest in their strengths and talents. A better Tomsk and a better Russia can only be created by the skills of its people, not merely its leaders."

This has given the Humanists great popularity with the people and within the salons.\n\nAlongside their simple solutions and promises of a better life the Humanist's ideology has reached all the hearts and minds of Tomsk.

The new president to be voted in will wield the executive power of the government and will decide how all of Tomsk will move forward into the future. Also with the election of the president comes the party's own constitution, which allows the party to govern how they want, instead of governing within the rules of a set constitution. While it may only last as long as the party is in power, it still means each party has the power to transform the entire government. The association's vote could quite possibly change the future of Tomsk."

They are allowed to vote only in special jurisdictions of the cities and towns, and only at certain times of day. While this process has been criticized, it still provides stability and security for our election and republic. Some may say everyone should be able to vote, not just the educated, but for now, a safe election is all that is important. Change can wait until the next party in power decides how to run the elections."

It might have been an emergency measure, but to say that the average citizen could not decide for themselves the best courses of action in defense of their City was unacceptable. The people drew inward, becoming apathetic towards their role in a democracy, and a critical part of the ideals of the republic now lies again on its deathbed.\n\nShostakovich and his ministries aim to change this.

He is expected to reassert the Bastillards' defiance of populism and his government's devotion to progress, industry and a new urban culture for the 20th century in Russia.\n\nSeveral union leaders and political ideologues already decry our government as one made for the elite, and insensible to the needs of the masses. We dismiss these concerns as irrelevant. A strong father need not care for the whimpering of his offsprings; only about the family's fortunes and the opportunities granted to his progeny."

 ERS_bend_to_the_industrial_unions_desc:0 "With foreign investment nonexistent and local private investors unwilling to invest into our unstable economy, it falls upon the government to stimulate the economy through investments. Unfortunately, the only way to build any roads or factories is through the industrial unions, tycoons and capitalists whose brutal working conditions and exploitative practices have angered many workers. Many industrial workers will not like our cooperation with them, after all, many of these workers may have been injured and even killed by such unsafe working conditions. Many workers think we should actually be cracking down on these so-called unions rather than cooperating with them. However, if we want the factories to run and the construction projects to get built, we'll need to negotiate. In the end, it will be to the benefit of everyone."

Given how far north we are, our agricultural situation is always teetering between sufficiency and rationing. A poor crop season could mean the end of our small democracy. We should check in on our farmers and their farms to ensure their health and safety. Furthermore, we should begin planning on how we can increase our agricultural productivity, whether that be through more efficient machinery or some new kind of fertilizer."

 ERS_cooperation_agenda_desc:0 "Efficiency can only be achieved with all apparatuses of the economy moving as one. By connecting our farmers with the various food companies and our central planning committee, we will be able to coordinate the entire agriculture industry. With all these moving parts now under our control, it's only logical that we try to organize it now. Given the rate at which our population is growing, there has been massive job growth with few workers to sate this labor demand. We should rectify the shortage by moving workers from our crowded cities to the countryside temporarily, not only to boost agricultural productivity, but also to provide employment to the many unemployed in the city."

From here we will be able to coordinate all manner of industrial, residential, and business developments within cities and towns. Additionally, we should bring in our private sector associates in order to accommodate their needs and the needs of the companies they represent. Should all go well, we should notice a great reduction in construction times and general increase urban development as a result."

It's trading routes and abundance of furs and ivory made it one of the wealthiest and influential cities of the region. It was the Baghdad of Siberia. Sadly, over the course of centuries, a series of Tsars with little care or even knowledge of Mangazeya destroyed the city with their own geopolitical concerns. However, times have changed yet again, and Tomsk has need of the northern trade routes and access to the arctic sea that Mangazeya was provided. A new Mangazeya will be built, both as a bastion for the northern borders and as a trade hub from whence the riches of the outside world will be available to us."

In order to preserve this prosperity we will need to ensure that future governments hold to this policy of cooperation with the private sector as well. An organization will be created to help integrate public and private firms alike.

This ambitious plan has several goals, among which includes boosting resource production, increasing factory productivity, and building more infrastructure. With hope, these measures will not only serve to increase Tomsk's general productivity, but also serve to strengthen Tomsk's military industrial strength. All that's left is to decide how our resources should be divided."

Heavy industry can refer to a number of industries, from steel and chemical manufacturers to electrical and automotive production, which all typify the modern industrial nation. We should invest into these industries so that they may form the basis of a far more robust and influential economy. Additionally, an investment into our heavy industry is also an investment into our future productivity.

The production of guns, artillery, and ammunition must be prioritized if we are to maintain our freedom and independence of our nation. Without a doubt our enemies are just as surely building up their armies and military industries as we plan to.

Not only does infrastructural investment provide excellent monetary stimulus for our economy, but it also also makes commerce easier to conduct in and around our lands, encouraging trade. It also eases the extraction of resources from our land. Furthermore, an investment into our infrastructure could also be considered an investment into our defense.

However, we will assert that the Bastillard Society makes its own path. This will increase our political prestige and reassure many workers that our government disdains all outside concerns, not only the poor workers'.

The workers of our Republic are not only earning a living wage for themselves and their family, but building the future of our nation.\n\nThus buttressed by material and psychological gains, the workers of our nation will bring the Republic in a new era of prosperity!"

However the years of chaos have prevented us from reinvesting much in industrial tools. To stop the waste of time caused by tools breaking down or needing increased maintenance, we must build a new generation of industrial equipment and give it to our workers.

Workers work hard simply because it is their station in life. In return the state offers them quantifiable improvements to current concerns.\n\nAs citizens realize that a non ideological, policy driven perspective is preferable, voter turnout will naturally lower and the Bastillard's non-ideological position will grow in strength.

Many of our Republic's small workshops operate in a legal gray zone, without full incorporation. It is thus hard to keep track of who is doing what, and who is legally responsible when a problem occurs. Our supply chain's smallest gears are thus needlessly fragile.\n\nWe must help small businesses to incorporate, to rectify this issue.

We have thus begun a new union, the People's Industrial Vanguard. This group's leadership, drawn from industrial workers and state bureaucrats, will apply rational economic principles to determine where the average citizen is missing needed ressources. Rights and privileges granted to industrial workers will be managed through back channels, to discredit mass action in favor of calm negotiations.

Better public transportations can help workers reach their factories. New schools can train the next generations.

Mechanizing agriculture, teaching modern techniques such as new fertilizer and pesticides, opening new agricultural schools. All these will increase yield and prosperity within the countryside.\n\nAn additional benefit is that a prosperous peasant is a happy peasant. Were there any trouble to break out in the cities, we can be assured that our rural citizens would happily side with the party of order against any upstart revolutionary.

Our infrastructure is woeful, leaving our city isolated islands of civilization within the vast green sea of Siberia. We must repair crumbling roads, dilapidated railways and decrepit pipelines, before we do anything else.\n\nIn peacetime this infrastructure will help us develop our economy, and will thus be merely vital.

Many of the buildings and landmarks of the city were built during the time of the Tsar, and while it is an honor to be able to house such precious historical architecture, especially considering how much of it was destroyed since the Russian Revolution, we must adapt for the modern era. By infusing the zeitgeist with refined aesthetics and culture that glorifies the industrial worker, we will hopefully be able to bring new energy and vitality to the workers as we work to improve industry in Tomsk.

We consider unions to play a valuable role in the economy, shielding the common man from the rapacity and greed of the businessmen and tycoons of Tomsk. To that end, we have endeavored to bring into law a variety of legal protections for unions and workers in Tomsk. The most important of these is our protection of sector wide bargaining. Hopefully, by enshrining sector wide bargaining into law, we will ensure that companies deal only in fair and efficient bargains with the public."

In order to achieve such a goal, we will embark upon a large-scale propaganda campaign, using posters, radion, cinema, and anything else we can influence.

We experienced such a cultural shift decades ago during the reign of Bukharin as thousands moved into the cities to work in the factories. As Russia stabilizes, the city will again become the basis of Russian society, and when it does, there will be a flowering of urban intellectual culture unlike anything seen before in Russia's past. However, such an urban renaissance can only occur if we provide it the conditions to exist. To that end, we must build Tomsk into a world class city, or at least make it a rival of old Moscow."

The workers are working, industry is humming along, the new government and its agencies are working fine, and it seems as if the quality of life has started to increase for everyone. It feels like everything is going to be alright. It's been a long time since Russians have been able to feel this way."

 ERS_Expanding_the_Core_desc:0 "During the unification wars, our military wasn't as powerful as our neighbors. The fight against the separatists and the rogue generals was made difficult by our rump military. It has been a rough start for our republican army, but one that must be addressed if we are to defend the territory we have conquered and continue expanding. Our military deficiencies are many, and there isn't any simple fix that will rectify it.\n\nThe military as a whole must be strengthened. Marshal Shaposhnikov has put forward a set of recommendations, on which all salons have been agreed upon. Such improvements will be expensive and time consuming, but necessary if we wish to one day reunite Russia."

 ERS_Stronger_Armor_desc:0 "One of the most important lessons learned from the Second World War was the necessity of a modern tank corps. Panzers with more powerful guns and stronger armor than we'd ever seen before broke through our lines as if they were made of putty. We face similar difficulties today. The warlords who have managed to acquire some portion of the former Soviet Union's tank stockpile or figured out some way to produce their own are often the warlords causing us the most damage and casualties. An armoured corp will be vital in ensuring our continued military supremacy."

 ERS_Better_weapons_desc:0 "The rifle is the most important tool the modern soldier has at his disposal, and the quality of a soldier's rifle is as important as the training he receives to use it. Even the greatest soldier armed with a musket wouldn't be able to do half as much damage in the field as an untrained conscript with a Kalashnikov. The more lead one can saturate the battlefield with, the greater the chance that something or someone is going to be hit with said lead. Our enemies across the border are surely working on newer and more advanced versions of the rifles they already have, and if we allow them to advance significantly past us, we may find ourselves overpowered in the field."

 ERS_Improved_organization_desc:0 "Uniting our region of Central Siberia was no simple task. It required the collective efforts of thousands of soldiers and officers working in tandem in order to subdue the smaller warlords on our borders. The experience these soldiers and officers have gained thus far will prove vital as we attempt to improve our military in the future. We should tap on this experience through the promotion of our most experienced and successful officers and soldiers. Additionally, we should begin interviewing our soldiers to see what they believe needs improvement in our armed forces."

 ERS_Republican_Eagles_desc:0 "For decades, the Luftwaffe has unleashed hellfire upon our Russian brethren in the west. There isn't a single Russian in those lands without a story to tell about the bombings. Men and women swept up in firestorms in cities, villagers seeing their village entirely destroyed in single carpet bombing, oil fields alight for days after a strategic bombing. All stories that support the common logic; If we lose the war in the air we lose the war and we lose it quickly. Aerial supremacy is of the utmost importance if we are to reunite Russia and one day combat Germany. Currently, our air force is a joke. We need to produce more planes and better quality planes if we are to catch up, and we need to do so rapidly."

 ERS_Steel_Caravans_desc:0 "Every army marches on its stomach, and if you can't supply an army's ravenous appetite, it will die. Living in the rough and varied lands of Russia, logistics can be a major challenge. Supply lines often run long and snake-like, leaving them vulnerable to attack. The terrain and weather can also make transportation of materials and goods a slow and arduous task, with snowstorms and mud a very real and present threat. Mitigating these threats to our supply lines through the use of new technology is vital in this regard. Improved trucks with all terrain capability alongside trains which can pull ever larger loads will surely increase our logistical capacity."

 ERS_Duty_to_the_Republic_desc:0 "Our army is an army of citizen soldiers. Our ranks are filled with men of the common folk, not elites from fancy school with special training. These are men who are doing their duty for the Republic, many of them volunteers. However, with each war our ranks dwindle further, even as our enemy's armies swell to ever larger sizes. We must go to the cities, the towns, and the villages of the Republic and ask them to help us defend our democracy. Those we help must help us defend the country if we are to survive."

 ERS_A_nation_of_Yeomen_desc:0 "We are a nation of peasants and yeomen. The vast majority of our people live on farms or in isolated villages. This can make it quite difficult to call upon them for the military, for when a peasant with little knowledge of rifles or riflery is suddenly given a kalashnikov and sent into battle, he has just as much of a chance of killing his own comrades as he does the enemy. In order to rectify this issue, we will begin mandating a few hours rifle training every week for men and women over sixteen. They will be given rifles and taught to shoot at targets in local shooting fields. Thus, when the time comes for them to fight, they will be able to slip into the soldiers role with ease."

 ERS_Military_Education_desc:0 "Officers are one of the vital pieces of the modern military unit. His responsibilities include organizing his men, coordinating with other officers, and leading his men in battle. The qualities we believe to be of the greatest importance in executing those three tasks are initiative and creativity. Officers trained in our military academies have this idea of initiative and ingenuity drilled into them. For example, officers must be able to generate at least three solutions to any one test we present them, and execute it in a reasonable amount of time.There are hundreds of young, creative, and motivated soldiers in our armed forces who have the potential to be officers, but cannot afford the cost of schooling. We must make officer training and schooling available to these men so that we might capitalize on their skills and ambition."

 ERS_Principle_of_Directive_management_desc:0 "The worst possible thing a military can do to itself is implement a rigid chain of command with strict oversight, where every action must be pre approved by the man above him. It can allow one to exercise great control over their military, but it also ensures that your lower ranks will be essentially braindead, and will limit your army's effectiveness. Instead, one should encourage their lower ranks to think for themselves as to how to interpret or apply strategic directives from above. The officers and troops on the ground often understand the immediate military situation a lot better than generals miles away from the front lines do. If your men can't function autonomously from high command, then the second your men are encircled or communications cut off, they are as good as dead."

 ERS_Moderne_Amalgame_desc:0 "During the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars, the French military would often mix conscripts with their core army. In doing so, they ensured their conscripts would be brought quickly up to speed with the rest of the army, developing their skills through close proximity with experienced soldiers. We should endeavor to do the same, taking our conscripts and mixing them in with our professional army, bringing everyone up to speed on the front lines and saving the army plenty of time in training."

 ERS_Support_weapon_corps_desc:0 "The two single greatest military innovations to come out of the 19th century was artillery and machine guns. These two weapons together would prove to be some of the most deadly and destructive in human history, with a death toll in the tens of millions and climbing. The ability to bombard an enemy position from miles away or to saturate an enemy position with hundreds of bullets in a matter of seconds is an incredible advantage. We must train our men on the use and maintenance of these weapons, including them as part of our mandatory military training program."

 ERS_Military_healthcare_desc:0 "The men we have on the front line deserve the best medical care we have to offer. They risk their lives every day protecting us at home, the least we can do for them is provide decent healthcare. Additionally, in providing them better medical care, we minimize our losses and preserve valuable military experience that these soldiers accumulate on the battlefield. Even more importantly, providing them free military healthcare will boost morale in the armed forces, encouraging our men to fight harder and take bigger risks, knowing that they will be covered in the event of a medical emergency."

 ERS_Strong_Undaunted_Defiant_desc:0 "The Citizen Army stands strong! Following numerous reforms and expansions, we can now proudly say that our army is one of the greatest in all of Russia. Should any nation be so foolish as to attack us, we will have thousands of men, citizens of this great Republic, ready to crash upon the enemy like a tidal wave, sweeping through their lines and past them towards their capital. Should they survive that, our tanks divisions will pincer them from the sides as artillery rains down upon them like hail. Let it not be said Tomsk could not fight."

Our republic is real, with legitimate democratic elections, rejection of the one party state, and with freedom of speech and expression for all citizens. Sadly, ours is a unique path, and there aren't many who follow our ways. Hopefully, however, in time we will be able to spread democracy to all of Russia."

 ERS_Potential_Enemies_desc:0 "There aren't many democracies among the warring states of Russia. Most are communist one party states, facist dictatorships, or military juntas, and all of which are hostile to our continued existence. Dealing with these threats will require the finesse of diplomacy as well as the muscle of the military. Any nation on our borders could be a possible enemy, it's up to our diplomats to find out who intends to be, and our military to make sure that they don't. As we trend ever closer towards the inevitable reunification of Russia, our list of enemies will only grow. It's important we be prepared."

 ERS_Diplomatic_education_desc:0 "A republic only functions so long as the people stay involved and vote. However, this is only possible if the people stay informed. Too many of our citizens are either unaware or misunderstand of our foreign policy, with many believing lies about it in the absence of other information to the contrary. We should turn our foregin policy into more easily digestible information for the worker's consideration. We will explain our positions and reasoning for the actions we take with other nations on our borders and abroad, and hopefully our citizens will approve."

 ERS_Potential_friends_desc:0 "Though we are mostly alone as a social democracy in Russia, there are still many socialist nations who might be amenable to us. Our government is often more moderate than many of these socialist nations, but we are certainly more similar to each other than to the various fascist and despotist nations in Russia. We should reach out to these socialist nations, and should our meetings go well, potentially establish some mutually beneficial relationships. In these cold, sprawling wastes we call home, danger abounds across every hill and behind every tree. We would do well to have some allies."

For centuries we have traded with each other, fought against each other, and in past decades, with each other. These lands now lay as divided as Russia, but this state of affairs likely won't hold. There are various warlords and nation states who contend for dominance over the region, and who also might be acquiescent to an alliance or some sort of mutual defense pact. In any case, we must strive to appear as strong and favourable potential allies should such a Central Asian nation ever choose to support a contender for Russian reunification."

 ERS_Through_Cathay_desc:0 "As we march onwards towards the reestablishment of Russian power on the world stage, we mustn't forget the nations with which we are to share borders. To our east lies one of the strongest nations in all the world at this moment: Japan. Over the course of several decades since the beginning of the century, Japan has slowly but surely conquered all of East Asia, most impressively pushing through most all of China, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia during the Second World War. However, despite Japan's impressive conquests, its grip over Asia slackens. The Chinese giant stirs, and Japan may not be prepared for what it will unleash. We should endeavor to endear ourselves towards China and the Chinese nations on the Sphere's periphery in the hopes that we might one day secure an alliance."

 ERS_Toward_our_Destiny_desc:0 "Our Republic has surpassed any and all expectations others had of it. Time and time again, we have proven that not only is our way of government practical, but it is also righteous. We have conquered all of Central Siberia and in due time will move to conquer, whether diplomatically or militarily, the rest of Russia. Our march towards the reunification of all of Russia has now become, for all intents and purposes, unstoppable. Democracy will reign from Arkhangelsk to Petropavlovsk, and, one day, from Moscow to Vladivostok as well. Long live the Republic!"

 ERS_Expanding_Politics_desc:0 "The Republic stands triumphantly over all its former territories!\n\nYet in this hour of victory, the Republic has perhaps never been more divided politically. Emboldened by years of independence, separatists, former siloviki, mutineers of Krasnoyarsk and anarchists of the SBA all mill around, uncertain of their future, and wary of our political system.\n\nOur innovative constitution is limited in some aspects, with its strict emphasis on the four greatest salon. At the same time, Pasternak's great constitution empowers us to experiment, to try new things, to welcome new ways of doing things.\n\nIf our great republican project is to endure, we must dare to dream ever bigger dreams, and inspire ever greater amount of people to believe in our ideals. The republic must endure!"

 ERS_Discord_In_The_Salons_desc:0 "The topic of how to integrate so many new citizens into the salon system has sparked quite the debates in the great salons of Tomsk.	 Some argue that the common constitution should be amended; others suggest political restrictions that would cast an ominous shadow over our democratic dream.\n\nIt is important to calm tempers and soothe the chaos within the salons. We will need every salon to operate at its peak if we're to offer a united front to calm the political storm. By appealing to everyone's heart and minds, we will be able to pool the vast talents of Tomsk together to figure out new solutions to the crisis."

 ERS_Subversive_Parties_desc:0 "Already new citizens of the republic are assembling to form new political parties. Some are fairly mundane liberal or conservative. Others are more extremist, such as a radical agrarian anarchist party, or are mere front for dangerous group of former military separatists or shadowy businessmen.\n\nTheir progress are limited in some way by Tomsk's constitution; all candidates have to be endorsed on the electoral list of one of the four great salons. We can further monitor the situation by putting dangerous parties and associations under police surveillance. This will go against our idealist principles, but be an invaluable source of information. Once a list of moderate and extremist factions is drawn up, we can encourage moderates to join the salon system, and try to eliminate extremist influence."

 ERS_DecembristS_Urge_To_Calm_desc:0 "The Decembrist society has long been seen as the odd man out in Tomsk, conservative and more prudent in its vision of the new idealist Republic. This prudence should not be mistaken for cowardice, however, as Dmitry Likhachov is preparing a powerful speech arguing for calm and determination in maintaining the Republican system.\n\nTomsk's elites, he argues, are used to steering the ship of state, and a great deal of new talent has been developed since then end of the provisional government. This elite has the backing of the people, as the Republican system and the free society on which it stands are a public arena for ideas. As long as the citizens show faith in their institutions and leaders, those who try to divide the Republic are sure to fail!"

 ERS_HumanistS_Appeal_To_Reason_desc:0 "The Modernist society, rallying around Sakharov and Kamov, have published an appeal to reason. They argue that to panic is not befitting of Tomsk's leadership, and that the problem can be attacked rationally and efficiently.\n\nBy compiling information on new political candidates and attacking radical network of influence, calmer and saner candidates can be integrated to the salon system while demagogues and problematic politicians can be left to the wayside. The only need the Republic has right now, the Modernist argue, is for its leadership to maintain a clear head."

 ERS_HumanistS_Call_For_Compassion_desc:0 "The Humanist society has launched a series of radio ads, read by Shostakovich and Weinberg. The two friends beg the Republic's citizens to show love and compassion to the new citizens.\n\nMany that live in the new territories have endured years of dictatorship by radical elements. Now they are once more in the Central Siberian Republic, and are afraid for their future. Is it so surprising, then, that many seek extremists and demagogues as patrons? We should not begrudge drowning men and women for seeking ways to stay afloat. Rather, we should dive into the tumultuous waters and show our fellow citizens that there are few reasons to be afraid."

 ERS_BastillardS_Plea_For_Action_desc:0 "The Bastillard Salon has been at the forefront of the salon conferences in demanding action. Led by Kharms, the members of the Trinity Society have thundered publicly that now is not the time for indecision; the Republic fought hard to regain its former provinces. Now it must fight to integrate them, and to reduce its opposition to irrelevance.\n\nThe Salon system and Tomsk's rotating constitution are shields against extremism, granting the political caste supreme powers over proposing new laws to keep the Republic alive and strong. Now is the time to use these powers, to build a veritable rampart between the state and its enemies!"

 ERS_Freedom_For_The_Independants_desc:0 "The Modernist and Decembrist Salons have united behind a joint proposal to rewrite the common constitution to make it easier for properly vetted political independants to run under any salon of their choosing. The four great salons would still be allowed final say over their presidential candidates and policy platforms; however independants would be allowed to have full political career.\n\nThis proposal has been heavily criticized by the Bastillard for allowing populist poison to seep within Tomsk's system, and by the Humanists for weakening the party system. Nevertheless, the proposal is widely popular within the independent political crowd, and is likely to strengthen confidence in our Republic."

 ERS_Work_To_Integrate_The_Independant_Into_The_System_desc:0 "The Bastillard and Humanists, strange bedfellows as they may be, have countered the Humanist and Decembrist's proposal with a policy program of their own. Their joint program would see vast infrastructure investment in the new territories, allowing new citizens to get involved within the Republic's society. Over time their attachment to old ideas and old political factions would weaken, aided by the work of our intelligence agency in dissolving radical organizations. This slow way would in time reduce greatly reduce independant pressure on the Republic's systems.\n\nThis method, counter the Decembrists and Modernists, is little more than mass deployment of bribes and pork barrel spending, to buy peace from the new citizens. Nevertheless, the Humanists and Bastillards are forging ahead with their own campaign to see this new legislation passed."

 ERS_Advisory_Referendum_desc:0 "The common constitution allows for advisory referendums on thorny societal debates. A super majority of the deputies of the four salons now request an advisory referendum on the political issue: the referendum is to ask the citizens wether the Humanist-Bastillard program of long term integration, or the Decembrist-Modernist plan of independent political right is to be made the law of the land.\n\nThe campaign has spread throughout old and new territories. As mandated by the common constitution, the sitting President is in no way forced to follow the referendum's results. §RRejecting the popular will, however, is likely to have grave consequences on our legitimacy.§!"

 ERS_Novosibirsk_Conference_desc:0 "A great conference is to be held in Novosibirsk, under the recommendation of the Decembrist-Modernist program. There, independants of all sorts shall be brought within the salon system. Already a great number of political parties have come forward with candidate lists, applying for membership to a salon of their choosing.\n\nGiving out this much power to independants is likely to affect the political situation in the Republic for the coming years. To the plan's supporters, this is irrelevant. None should see their political freedom put on hold, no matter the circumstances. The nation trusts its people, and this trust shall be rewarded!"

 ERS_Integration_Bureau_desc:0 "The government is to go ahead with the Humanist-Bastillard plan. To help along with this, a new set of "Integration Bureau" will be deployed in all new territories. These bureaus will be staffed by neutrally appointed bureaucrats, and be tasked with aiding the integration of the new territory into the Republic's economy. Poverty, joblessness and political radicalism are to be fought hard against.\n\nThe Republic must do right by its new children. All shall be nourished, all shall be taught, and all shall be made proud to live in our great nation! Let cynics say what they may, none shall be left behind!"

 ERS_Dealing_With_Extremists_desc:0 "The government has now gone ahead with a program to tackle the political crisis. The wind has been taken out of much of our opposition. However, some determined critics of our Republic remain. Hardliner militarists in Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk, intractable critics of the late CSR, anarchists remnants in the far east, all united in their hatred of our government\n\nDiscord has once again broken out in the four salons over the topic of censure. Many argue that the Republic has no place for extremism, and that the voices of these enemies of the state should be silenced. Others point out that with our new approach to the political crisis, the opposition's power base dwindles day by day. Better to let the radicals rage to an ever shrinking crowd.\n\nThe President is likely to be asked to make a final decision."

 ERS_New_Friends_In_The_Salons_desc:0 "The four great salons have opened new branches all across the nation, and scores of curious citizens have begun attending them. Not all of our new residents find the salon system pertinent, but enough do that the four great societies have seen their membership swell.\n\nDozens of new thoughts, artistic techniques and political programs have begun swirling around each Salons. Despite the grumbling of the old guard, the growth of the salon system is in the long run the likeliest candidate to fully resorb the political crisis, and for that reason it could be a good idea for the central government to aid its spread throughout the nation.\n\nArts, science and politics shall be democratized! A new set of citizen assemblies are given birth throughout Central Siberia!"

 ERS_Resolving_The_Political_Crisis_desc:0 "Through cooperation and disputes, the four great salons have managed to weather this first political challenge to Pasternak's new republic.\n\nThe issues of independants politicians and of cynicism in our nation	are far from solved. Left to fester, these twin threats could end up fatally undermining our idealistic republic. This is no reason to despair, for our great democratic experiment also gives us the tools needed to weather this storm.\n\nWe must stand vigilant, remain true to ourselves, and open to compromise. Pasternak's legacy must endure, and as its guardians, the four great salons must constantly strive to rise above petty politics to ensure that the flame of idealism burns in Central Siberia!"

 ERS_The_PeopleS_Spring_desc:0 "Is it not beautiful, what we have achieved? A government, beholden to the people and in support of the common worker, managing to carve out a place in Central Siberia. Years ago, such a thing would have been treated as no more than mere fantasy. A pipe dream, dreamt up in the ivory towers of Tomsk by the intellectuals with knowledge of the real world. Yet, here we stand today, able to proudly say that we are citizens of a free republic in Russia. Many of our citizens bled for this achievement, and many more will surely die in the coming wars to reunite Russia. However, at least for a moment, our people are witnessing a Russian spring blooming in Siberia."

 ERS_The_Great_Labor_Conference_desc:0 "The Great Labor Conference is upon us! Citizens, young and old, are invited to take part in a grand meeting of workers, industrialists, capitalists, and more! Discussion will be varied, covering topics such as the implementation of new technologies and labor practices in industry, the extent of government involvement in the economy, privatization of certain nationalized government assets, and the direction and focus of the national economy going forward. All are encouraged to come and impart their opinions and feelings on these most important discussions."

 ERS_To_The_Victors_desc:0 "In our conquests of the various warlords and statelets of Central Siberia we've come into possession of a great deal of industrial machinery. Much of it is still operational, and what isn't can likely be repaired. We must begin cataloging and redistributing this machinery. The lion's share of it will be given to the worker's communes for their use in localized production. The next largest portion will go to the government for our needs in construction and manufacturing. The remaining pieces will be auctioned off at low prices to the capitalists in the nation, bringin the government a small profit and the capitalists more means with which to produce goods."

 ERS_Rights_And_Duties_desc:0 "Every relationship in life is a game of give and take. The same applies to the relationship between a government and its citizens. A government is obliged to maintain the roads, work to keep the crime rate low with police, and protect the citizens from outside threats like an invading nation with a military. In return, the people are compelled to pay taxes, go to school, participate in the military, and most importantly, vote. So long as both parties continue to do their part and uphold the relationship, the nation will thrive."

 ERS_The_Great_Clock_desc:0 "The citizens of our great Republic can be considered as cogs to a great clock. Each one of them minute in nature, serving a purpose as inscrutable to them as the purpose of timekeeping might seem to the tiniest gear nestled deep inside the machinery of the clock. However, every one of those gears and cogs working to keep the clock ticking are as vital to the clock's function as the arms on the face of the clock. Each one serves an invaluable purpose, just as every one of our citizens does for our grand democracy. Everyone has a place in society, and every person serves to make our nation greater."

 ERS_Regional_Synergy_desc:0 "One of the great difficulties of Russian geography is how isolated our various peoples can be. Whether they be separated by mountains, forests, or just the great distances of the Steppe, it is often a laborious task to bring an item from point A to point B. Such separation and isolation of our population makes ruling over any great portion of Russia difficult, hinders our industrial development, and encourages separatism. In order to combat the various issues that arise from our isolation, we should begin patching the railways systems of our disparate lands into one large, cohesive railways system. Just as a seamstress might repair a sweater, we will sew our lands together with rail."

 ERS_Improved_Healthcare_desc:0 "If there is one issue on which most all citizens are united, it's that our healthcare system could be improved. While the mechanism that provides the insurance and funding for healthcare is functional, the hospitals themselves are grossly out of date and in need of renovations. Machinery that's decades old, medicine that's long since expired, and far worse have been discovered in hospitals across the nation. While this may have sufficed in previous decades, we now live in a rapidly modernizing Russia where such inadequacy will no longer do. Hospitals will be allocated greater funding, and a new oversight committee will handle the further modernization of our nation's healthcare facilities."

 ERS_Family_Subsidies_desc:0 "Despite conjecture to the contrary, we are of the opinion that aid to the poor and ailing in Russia does more good than it does harm. By implementing a system of sustained fiscal stimulus into the poorest regions of our nation, we can raise the overall productivity and quality of life in those regions, eventually bringing them up to speed with the rest of Russia. By providing the poor family money with which to pay for their food and buy coal for their furnaces, we free up capital that they can spend on other products and appliances. By increasing consumption we boost industry, increase standard of living, and this upward spiral snowballs until the fiscal aid isn't even needed anymore."

 ERS_Guns_Of_The_Citizens_desc:0 "Our citizens are no strangers to the military. A good portion of them are serving right now, serving on the front lines or guarding the border, protecting us from whatever enemy might try to extinguish our light. A good deal more would certainly be willing to enlist and serve if not for one great problem our military has. It needs more arms. Guns, artillery, support equipment, you name it, we need it. Our citizenry may be ready and eager to serve, but our military just can't have them without any equipment. While we may be a peaceful people, our neighbors are assuredly not. If the need ever arises for a mass conscription and arming of the populace, we must be ready, which is why a large investment is needed in our military industry immediately."

 ERS_Bureau_Of_Military_Industrial_Development_desc:0 "Everything in warfare is industrialized now. Whether it be the truck one rides in to get to the battlefield, the scout plane one uses to scope out the battlefield, or the tank one drives to fight on the battlefield, all of it originates in factories far behind the front lines. One simply cannot do without these modern machines of war, and attempting to do so would be foolish. A new bureau is to be created which will manage the production and distribution of all the trucks, tanks, and aeroplanes coming out of those factories behind the front lines. Even if we can't beat the enemy with the quality of our weapons, we will at least be able to out-produce them."

 ERS_A_Great_Symphony_desc:0 "Our expert handling of the economy has resulted in a boom! Several sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, utilities, and finance have breached double digits in growth. With this explosive economic rise, we have seen a great deal of financial resources flooding our coffers. With these newfound resources, we can continue to invest back into our own economy, increasing quality of life, lowering unemployment, reducing crime, increasing stability, and boosting economic expansion in our country even further. A great symphony of steel and steam is coming together, and the changes this melody will bring Russia are unfathomable."

 ERS_Chair_Of_Economical_Research_desc:0 "As our national economy grows and diversifies, it will become increasingly unwieldy and susceptible to external market forces. The government has an obligation to the people to mitigate the influence and severity of these market fluctuations on the economy. Our method of combating this will be through greater integration and development of our domestic economy. A new governmental department will be formed, with the intent of further integrating our worker's coops, private businesses, and government industry. By encouraging further interdependence and communication between these sectors of the economy, we will be able to solidify our national economy."

 ERS_The_Decembrist_Forebears_desc:0 "The Decembrist Society takes its names after the original Decembrists, all noble veterans of the Napoleonic war. Just like our forebears, we shall fight tyranny wherever we find it!\n\nThe original Decembrist led and fought with humble Russian peasants. On the soil of Europe noble and common blood fell and mixed, drawing the two Russian societies closer together. It is time for the Republican army to adopt this ethos. Shaposhnikov's core army will lead thousands of recruits from all over the Republic in times of war. By supplementing our veterans in time of crisis with a flood of soldiers, we will be able to trap our ennemies between a hardened, mechanized anvil, and a vast hammer of artillery and light infantry.\n\nThe common people look to their political leaders in time of peace for guidance; in times of war they shall look up to find the Republic's elite leading them to glory and freedom!"

 ERS_Expand_The_Military_Academy_desc:0 "It is a grim business to study the dismal science. We cannot, however, let our enemies outdo us in the grim art of causing death and devastation.\n\nThe military academy in Tomsk will be expanded, and students of the military sciences will be incorporated into our army's planning. Modern ways of organizing forces will be analysed; new ideas about the distribution of support equipment at various levels will be tested; innovative ways to use psychology will be used to enhance the deadliness of artillery barrages.\n\nOur adversaries have oft mocked our intellectuals. It is us that shall have the final laugh when we unleash our mastery of the military sciences upon the battlefield."

 ERS_Clean_Conscription_desc:0 "If our army is to rely on masses of conscripts, it is important we make it clear to the people what we expect of them. Drafting peasants during the critical months of harvest, or conscripting urban workers haphazardly and making them lose their jobs are both ways in which the common man will grow to hate and resent military service.\n\nWe will maintain clear and accurate lists of men of military service age. From there, regional bureaus will seek to accomodate families and villages so as to avoid depleting local manpower in inopportune moments. Men joining the army will be given precise enlistment contracts, and none shall see their military service prolonged arbitrarily.\n\nIf we ask the people to give us something, the least we can do is be precise about our needs!"

 ERS_Special_Forces_desc:0 "Born from experiments in the Second World War, most modern armies feature at least some special purpose troops. Well trained and equipped with specialized equipment, special forces operatives can appear behind enemy lines and perform surgical cuts to enemy material and personnel. After all, an army operates in coordination, much like the human body. Is it so surprising, then, that the right cut at the wrong place can induce catastrophic consequences?\n\nThe Republic shall invest in its special forces, and incorporate elements from special force training into regular forces. Far better after all to experiment novel tactics with small groups of smart and dedicated soldiers, before spreading information to the rest of the army."

 ERS_A_New_Cavalry_desc:0 "Marshal Shaposhnikov's modernization and mechanization of the Republican Army has united several excellent veteran battalions into the embryonic form of a respectable armored corps. It is now time for us to build on his efforts and develop a formidable group of armored divisions! These soldiers will form the spearhead of the Republican Army; clad in steel and equipped with devastating fighting power, this modern cavalry will be a formidable asset for our army.\n\nSome question the idea of putting most of our veteran soldiers in armored divisions. The Decembrist society believes that the force multiplication of mobility and firepower will be best applied by our best soldiers. The versatility of our tank divisions will allow us to reinforce failing defenses as well as strike vulnerable ennemy position at rapid speed. Let us renew the awe inspiring shock of the cavalry of old!"

 ERS_Skirmishers_desc:0 "The illusions of the modern landscape reveal themselves a few hundred meters beyond roads and railways. Hills, forests, rivers and swamps make progression through nature unaltered a difficult proposition.\n\nFortunately, the common Russian peasant makes a living from his comprehension of the environment. Many citizens from the countryside are used to exploring forests looking for mushrooms or animal meat. In winter as in summer, these hardy men and women travel across the land to make a living. Their experiences can be incorporated into our reconnaissance regiments. While we may not always fight in Central Siberian nature, the institutional attitude of being prepared for anything will let our infantrymen go where they please and strike the enemy wherever it is most advantageous!"

 ERS_Private_To_Marshall_desc:0 "Some accuse the Decembrist society of elitism, of fermenting a new nobility able to lord over the common man. We deeply regret this misunderstanding. As our Decembrist forebears once sought to break down the walls between common and noble folk, so does our modern organization strive to unify all social groups of the Republic.\n\nIt is this crucial that we look for talent within the ranks. Humble soldiers should not be precluded from leading other men if they show promise. No matter a man's social group, out in the field there are only brothers leading brothers to defend the republic. We shall promote the best of the best, and order our army accordingly!"

 ERS_Militarize_The_Elite_desc:0 "Russia has a long and storied military history. Its leaders were once expected to know military life, and it was a rare noble family that did not sacrifice at least one military hero to the nation.\n\nTomsk has had a reputation as a city of artists, poets and scientists within the CSR. It is time for us to trade the pen for the sword. For Russia to be saved and for light and hope to endure, we must accept into our hearts sorrow, hardship, and the possibility of death on the battlefield. By once more militarizing the upper rungs of the Republican society, we seal our covenant with the common people in blood. The blood shed by the enemies of Russia, and the blood that shall be lost in liberating it.\n\nWe must fight, so that one day songs and poems replace explosions and gunshots across the Russian lands."

 ERS_The_Republican_Artillery_desc:0 "It is the great axiom of modern warfare that firepower kills. The vast, vast majority of casualties on armies of the twentieth century result from artillery shells of various sizes, lobbed from great distance.\n\nThis lesson was taught to Europe by the little corporal himself, and a century later the armies of the Great War fielded gun batteries that would no doubt have impressed Napoleon himself. We shall place the Republican army in this tradition by maintaining a permanent artillery corp, to be placed at our conscripted infantry's disposal. The long guns of the Republic will be our infantry's swords and shields!"

 ERS_Towards_A_New_Patriotic_War_desc:0 "It was not the decrepit Habsburg Empire that ended Napoleon's rampage through Europe, nor the haughty militarist Prussians, nor even the sophisticated and modern British. The Grande Armée was fatally wounded by the Russian nation through its long advance through Russia and at the battle of Borodino, never recovering its prestige.\n\nIn the other Russian warlords and in the Wehrmacht we face a different, more dangerous foe. The former will stop at nothing to break Russian democracy; the latter will mortgage their own future if given the chance to finally destroy the Russian people. A new, even more terrible Great Patriotic War is on the horizon. One we shall win! Russia will never bend to tyrants!"

 ERS_The_Siberian_Phoenix_desc:0 "The fall of the Russian Republic in 1918 shocked the world; it harbinged the rise of the first communist nation, and the end of a brief experiment in Russia of republican democracy. In the aftermath of the fall of Bukharin's union many assumed that the Central Siberian Republic would form the kernel of a new Russian Republic. When it too, fell, all wrote off the rump government in Tomsk as likely to fall within the year.\n\nNow the Central Siberian Republic is back, stronger than ever! The world shall hear of this good news, as we try to make the best of our isolated and land locked position to reach the wider world. It is time for a diplomatic charm offensive."

 ERS_Far_From_Friends_desc:0 "Europe is in agony, the continent of the enlightenment critically wounded by fascism, few nations spared from gangrene as the Third Reich agonizes. Yet, one beacon of the old West remains beyond the Atlantic, the United States of America.\n\nThe Americans are not perfect, and they are very far from us. This shall not preclude us from reaching out to them. Any financial aid or scrap of recognition we can deprive our rivals from will go a long way toward helping us reach the top of the Russian unification."

 ERS_Close_To_Rivals_desc:0 "To the east, on the shores of the Pacific, and to the west, near the great Ural mountains, various Russian states are emerging from the Russian Anarchy. Our intelligence agencies have reported a range of candidates for Russian unification, from professional remnants of the Red Army, to military juntas of the type we found in Novosibirsk, to thing as far afield as German death cults and theocratic popular uprisings.\n\nWe must be ready for anything. Being able to negotiate diplomatic integration of any moderate republic we find into our own government would be a great boon. Being forced in a fight to the death for the future of Russia would be of great danger to our mission. We must be prepared."

 ERS_A_Declaration_Of_Intention_desc:0 "Many we encounter have heard of the transformation of the Central Siberian Republic and ask of our commitment to Democracy and Russian freedoms. To clarify the purpose of our mission to expand the Russian Federation, we shall present a declaration of intention.\n\nAll of the salons in Tomsk fight to maintain the flame of democracy in Russia. Of all the political associations, the Decembrist Society is the one most dedicated to the people's freedom, to the respect of tradition and to the embrace of modernity and western ideas. Wherever the Republic meets friends of liberty, it shall embrace them with open arms. Our enemies should not mistake this kindness for naivety; the errors of the past have taught us well. All threats to democracy will be terminated in the appropriate manner, their perpetrators judged and reeducated."

 ERS_The_Northern_Path_desc:0 "It is not true in a strictly speaking way that we are a landlocked nation. To the north is the Arctic Sea, one of the hardest to navigate bodies of water in the world. Frozen most of the year, and barely reachable from the east or west, our distant northern shores are a mixed blessing.\n\nHowever, it is important we make use of all we have. Flying a great circle route over the northern Arctic allows diplomatic planes to significantly cut down their travelling distance. Local fishermen also extract stocks of food that can supplement our resources. Settlement like Dikson on the Arctic shores and villages among the Yenisei Gulf can serve as refuelling points for planes and ships in the region."

 ERS_The_Southern_Path_desc:0 "The recent years have not been kind to Central Asia. With the breakdown of the Soviet Union, the western parts of Central Asia such as Kazakhstan have fallen to warlordism and banditry. As to the east, Xinjiang lives haphazardly in Tokyo's orbit, its daily affairs left to local strongmen as has been tradition since the beginning of the Chinese Warlord era.\n\nCentral Asia is also one of our few ties to the outside world. Through Xinjiang we can reach the Sphere's leadership. To the west in resurgent Kazakhstan, local trade and air hubs have reached much deeper into the south, to Persia and India. It is a long path to the wider world, but one we have to traverse as long as the shores of the Pacific are denied to us. Time to start visiting local leaders with gifts and diplomats, to see what kind of deal we can reach."

 ERS_The_Russian_Federation_Is_On_The_March_desc:0 "The world thought us buried. Thought the Central Siberian Republic a failed state, a mere moment of calm in the chaos and horror of the Russian Anarchy. Thought the militarists, the anarchists and the other separatists had fatally wounded Pasternak's dream.\n\nThey shall dismiss us no more! The Central Siberian Republic of old was reborn in war, its egg warmed by the hope and determination of the common Russian people. Our state forms the embryo of a new Russia, one determined to fight for freedom and equality for all our citizens. Let our enemies quake in fear! Let our friends rejoice! The Russian Federation is on the march."

 ERS_Legacy_Of_The_Workers_Uprising_desc:0 "It's imperative for our long term survival that our citizens believe that the economy of our nation is fair and functional. The workers uprising was a direct result of our failure to convince them of that fact. Many of those workers that participated in the revolt had been exploited by the government and private businesses during our expansions on the Siberian Plan, working long hours and hard shifts, boosting overall production and mineral efficiency, only to get nothing in return. Is it any wonder they were so angered? In any case, we must begin to improve the economy and quality of life in our nation so as to avoid such violence in the future."

 ERS_Watch_The_Private_Sector_desc:0 "The private sector is much like a toddler, capable of bringing one great joy, but when not handled correctly can make your life a living hell, an outcome we'd much like to avoid. As we attempt to reform the economy and implement good policy, we must be cognizant of the ever ravenous and greedy businessmen in the private sector. If, during our attempts to deregulate the market or implement new taxation policies, we leave even a minor loophole or misplaced comma, we could end up losing tens of millions of dollars. We mustn't let the private sector get ahead of us."

 ERS_Rationalize_Soes_desc:0 "The government and a large and unwieldy thing. Like a giant, its motions are clumsy and sweeping, and often inefficient. Such is the case with many of the government's State Owned Enterprises, or SOE's for short. These government run organizations suck up millions of dollars every year, and we seem to have accumulated quite a few of them. It's time to cut back and slim down the government. We will have to analyze the functions and success of our various enterprises and decide what to merge, what to privatize, and what to close down."

 ERS_Relief_For_Farmers_desc:0 "Heavy fighting in recent years has disrupted many rural areas within our nation. Fields have been shelled, tread over, and in some rare cases, gassed as well. Crop production has fallen across the nation and many farmers are unable to make ends meet as a result of circumstances entirely out of their control. We must work to aid these ailing farmers. Free materials and supplies for rebuilding will be made available to all farmers whose livelihoods have been destroyed. Additionally, tax exemptions will be offered to farmers affected as they work to repair their farms."

 ERS_Report_From_The_Commission_On_Industry_desc:0 "A few months back, a commission was created with the purpose of identifying immediate issues that need resolving in our industrial sector. The commission recently published a report discussing the various problems our nation has, and they are immense. Massive damage is being inflicted on our environment, workers rights are being abused, and poorly maintained, in some areas nonexistent, infrastructure is choking transportation around the nation. The issues presented have no simple solutions, and balancing the economy with other interests of the nation will prove difficult."

 ERS_Integrating_The_Siberian_Plan_desc:0 "The Siberian Plan was the final legacy of Nikolai Bukharin. In the final years of the Second World War and a few months afterwards, Bukharin had laid the groundwork for a massive industrial system to be created far behind the front lines and protected by the Urals in Siberia. Significant progress had been made with the plan, but ultimately, with Bukharin's fall, it was abandoned. Now with our ascent, however, not only will we finish what he started, we will use modern technology and industrial techniques to expand the plan far beyond what was ever planned for it."

 ERS_Environmental_Rights_desc:0 "Although the Siberian Plan has done much to amplify our productive capability and provide us an industrial base, it's also had numerous effects on the environment. Our scientists have noted increasing contamination of rivers, lakes, and other sources of drinking water for the public, increased rates of acidic rain, and vastly increased amounts of smog. Many in our salon have taken issue with the vast and increasing destruction of the environment that our industrialization efforts have brought, and demanded that action be taken. It may be time to take a stand on environmental rights and issue regulation to protect our natural resources."

 ERS_Workers_Rights_desc:0 "The delicate balance between worker's rights and business owner's profits is a fickle thing. While instinctively, one might automatically side with the workers, it's important to remember without the capitalists, there would be no investment into the economy, save government expenditures. However, treading too much on worker's rights could lead to riots, rebellions, and even revolution if we're not careful. And so the government walks this fine line, attempting to appease both sides and not hand to much power to either faction."

 ERS_A_Light_Touch_desc:0 "The free market is one of the most powerful and transformative forces on Earth. In just a few decades, the free market turned the backwater agrarian United States into a global industrial superpower. Being that Russia was first under communist rule and then unsplit between dozens of warlords, we were never able to experience these transformative effects. Now, however, we've reunited a significant portion of Russia and have built an economic framework in which the free market can thrive. It's time to sit back, relax, and let the free market do its work."

 ERS_Healing_The_Land_desc:0 "Decades of Luftwaffe bombings, wars, roving raider bands, and smog inducing industrialization has taken a mighty toll on these lands. Forests lie barren, destroyed by years of heavy fighting and destruction. The links of rail and road that once held the nation together are now disjointed and fragmented. However, it doesn;t have to stay this way. Peace and civil governance is returning to these lands, and so too does the opportunity to fix all that we've wronged. The forests can be regrown, and the new railways put down to sew the nation together again. What point is there in reuniting Russia if all that's left is ash?"

 ERS_Toward_Modernity_Confidently_desc:0 "The Russian peasant and worker is a cautious optimist. He must be, or else he wouldn't be able to survive in bleak lands such as these. However, in recent years, with our slow advance across Russia, he may finally have reason to be. Our state is a democracy, with liberty for all. Our industry is advanced, and sits atop the sturdy basis of the Siberian Plan. Our free market policies have opened the country to foreign investments and new technologies. Most importantly of all, under our rule, peace and civility is returning to his lands. The barbarous Russia of old is gone. A new, modern Russia approaches."

If our great republic is to survive, we will need to greatly expand our army and its capabilities. Though our small beacon of democracy has come a long way, the Unification Wars are far from over. As long as Russia remains divided, we must prepare for the possibility that, even against fellow democratic nations, we will have to fight. We must endeavor to field an ever more powerful, larger, and modern military, capable of dealing with every possible threat."

 ERS_The_Jotunns_Chariots_desc:0 "The future of large scale land warfare is in armor. Tanks, IFVs, APCs, and all the rest are increasingly going to become the standard in this mechanized world of ours. The advantage that thick armor and piercing explosives offer on the battlefield is immense, and necessary if going up against similar units. Ideally, by the time we confront Germany, we should hope to have fully mechanized elite forces to combat Germany's large panzer fleet. If not, we may find ourselves in the Second World War all over again."

 ERS_We_Fly_Where_We_Please_desc:0 "If we control the skies, we control the war. Unfortunately, we don't control the skies right now. Our air force is not only pitiful in numbers, but wildly outdated, with some of our oldest aircraft having been manufactured as early as the late 1930s. German jets and jets bombers are leagues ahead of ours, several times faster and equipped to fly at altitudes thousands of meters higher. We need to research jet engine technology and advance our air capabilities, if for no other reason than to gain a leg up on neighbors."

 ERS_No_Matter_The_Terrain_desc:0 "Historically, geography has been a major limiting factor in warfare. Assaulting across a river, up into a mountain, or into forests would give your enemy's a major advantage over you. This holds true even today, however, modern technology can help mitigate the problem. Come across a river? Deploy an AVLB. Attacking a mountain position? Use modern rappelling devices. Attacking into a forest? Use air cavalry to smoke them out. Better training and technology will ensure that in no cases will these natural impediments ever slow us down."

 ERS_The_Zealous_Elite_desc:0 "Instead of making an ever larger and more cumbersome military, we should instead be focusing on creating a smaller, better trained, and better equipped army. The advantage of this is that our forces will pack a hell of a stronger punch in whatever battles they are to fight in and will also take far fewer casualties as a result of having more experience and material at their disposal. Furthermore, we will be able to select only the best of our citizenry for the army, choosing only the most loyal and talented. Our new army will be fanatical in its defense of the republic, vowing hatred of the republic's enemies and accepting no failure or surrender in the face of overwhelming odds."

 ERS_Modern_Knights_desc:0 "One of the greatest draws of Knighthood for those in the middle ages was the prestige that the rank drew. Knights were elite forces, so distinguished as to be considered a form of lower nobility. We must do the same for our army. Serving should be thought of as the highest honor and treated with the highest respect. We should portray our army as accepting only the best, the crème de la crème. If we can convince the people of this fact, then we will be able to greatly increase the number of volunteers to choose from. After all, if the people believe a path to prestige and respect lies in service, they will surely enlist."

 ERS_Valkyries_Of_The_Sky_desc:0 "Air cavalry has proved one of the most impressive military innovations of the past several years. Used extensively during the South African War, their utility and efficiency has led to its mass adoption in major militaries across the world. If we wish to bring our forces towards military dominance in Russia, we should adopt this new and promising helicopter technology and integrate it into our forces. We have reason to believe that these air cavalry units will vastly increase our combat capabilities."

We dream of a future where the blue collar worker is as secure in his livelihood as the white collar worker, of a future where all humanity is united in democratic self governance. A lofty ideal to be sure, but one that may be possible in due time with the right allies."

 ERS_Render_Unto_Caesar_desc:0 "The greatest driver of any modern economy is credit. The ability for Russian entrepreneurs to be able to take out loans on the promise of future profitability for their companies is massive. It would spur massive growth in the economy as more secure foreign banks help Russian businessmen grow their companies and the overall economy to heights never seen before. However, this is only possible if Russia breeches the international financial markets. Our current credit rating is low amongst most major international banks, and they aren't willing to invest and possibly lose money on a nation in such a vulnerable position like our own. We work towards making friends in the financial community and see if we can change their minds."

 ERS_Cultural_Missions_desc:0 "Russia has been stuck in the 1940s for decades now as nations around the world moved forwards into the modern era of today. They have evolved scientifically, culturally, and economically in ways that seem radical to us. We should send our diplomats to these foreign countries to explore how their society has changed, and what changes we might expect in our own culture and society as we industrialize and shift into the global middle, and possibly even upper, class. Hopefully, such preparation will allow us to preempt some of the worst growing pains."

 ERS_The_Foreign_Policy_Council_desc:0 "As our nation rapidly approaches preeminence among the various Russian powers, we will increasingly find ourselves in contact with foreign powers, whether diplomatically, economically, or even culturally. We should assemble the greatest minds of our nation in a council to help chart a course for the nation in managing the interests of the various powers we will be working with and against in the future. This council will further help us to decide what kind of foreign policy goals we should have with our neighbors and interests abroad, like encouragement of foreign investment, technology sharing, and mutual economic agreements."

 ERS_Hoping_For_The_Best_desc:0 "Our state has grown strong as a contender for reunification, and many warlords have taken notice. As our armies continue their unstoppable march in nearly every direction, several smaller warlords have contacted us about the possibility of truce, or even a peaceful reunification. If we were to be able to negotiate the peaceful return of these smaller nations into the fold, that would greatly increase both our standing and the value of these regions, given that they will suffer no damage from war. We should open up diplomatic channels with these smaller neighbors and see what we might be able to do."

 ERS_Preparing_For_The_Worst_desc:0 "By failing to prepare, one is preparing to fail. Though we have only hopes of peaceful reunification, we must prepare for the possibility that negotiations will end in war. Plans must be drawn up for the various scenarios that might play out, such as a northern armoured assault or southern infantry thrust. Any good diplomatic negotiation is backed with the implication of a nation's military power, so we should have our forces at the ready on our borders. Should diplomacy break down and war is declared, we will be ready to move in at a moment's notice."

 ERS_Truth_Unshackled_desc:0 "Our republic stands for all that is good in humanity. We stand for truth, justice, and democratic self governance. There are nations and people in Russia who are fundamentally opposed to these concepts, who would seek for nothing more than to enslave all the people of Russia under a singular dictatorial rule. We are those who stand against them, the righteous and the moral, whose obligation is to spread such virtue to all of Russia. We will never Our foes cannot expect to hold us off for long."

 ERS_Bukharins_Inheritor_desc:0 "Though Bukarin's sins were many, his legacy in the Siberian Plan was great. A massive industrial complex, spanning the breadth of Siberia, complete with resource extraction operations, infrastructure, and modern factories of their time. Though the Soviet Union collapsed before any great use could be made of it, our nation happened to coalesce right on top of it in Tomsk. With the vast economic resources of the Siberian Plan at our disposal, we have a strong basis on which to form the rest of our modern economy."

 ERS_Talk_To_The_Worker_desc:0 "As we learned decades ago during the October Revolution, to ignore the worker and his needs is to invite revolution and bloodshed. We must consider what we can provide the worker, after all, all of our work in developing our industry, the Siberian Plan, and every other economic endeavor we've embarked upon has been for the benefit of the people. What use will it have all been if it's just the capitalists and industrialists reaping the benefits of our collective hard labour? In any event, we must be wary that the common worker doesn't get too displeased."

 ERS_Tea_With_The_Bosses_desc:0 "Just as we must not ignore the workers, we would be remiss to ignore the thoughts and wishes of the captains of our industry. It is imperative that we move forward developing our economic plans in tandem with the market so that our nation's businesses and economy flourish as we implement the Central Siberian Plan.\nLet's sit down and have some lengthy discussions with the most powerful businessmen throughout Central Siberia. If they bring a willingness to cooperate and a good faith in our desire to help the economy grow, we'll bring the tea."

 ERS_Hear_From_The_Bureaucrats_desc:0 "Above all, Central Siberia under our vision is run by and relies on our extensive civil service. In order for them to carry out the industrialization plan, we need to start assigning and delegating like crazy. But before we can rush into things, we need to hear what the situation on the ground is for our bureaucratic staff. Every last drop of information regarding the status of our bureaucracy and our current progress on industrialization must be submitted posthaste. Give us numbers, give us stats, give us everything you have! Move it, people!"

 ERS_A_Fair_Deal_desc:0 "We've heard from both workers and businessmen from all over Central Siberia. Unfortunately, as expected, their desires do not always overlap. In fact, there is a significant amount of conflict between these two groups, and we need to smooth things over as soon as possible.\nOur government is beginning to strictly enforce an extensive arbitration process that will hold hearings to resolve disputes between the workers and their bosses. Workers being forced to do too much overtime in the name of industrialization? Arbitrate. Bosses angry at their employees for demanding too much paid leave? Arbitrate. Any other problem? You guessed it: Arbitrate.\nBy staying out of these matters and allowing a neutral third party to resolve any and all issues, both worker and businessman will say we have given them a fair deal."

 ERS_Calibrated_Performance_desc:0 "The amount of numbers being crunched, buildings being constructed, permits being granted, goods being produced, and paperwork being filed is beyond overwhelming. In order to help businessmen, bureaucrats, and academics alike maintain and adjust ongoing plans as necessary, we will consolidate all of our data into one publicly available database that anyone can access. No doubt we will need to assign several civil servants to manage this data store full time, as it will be massive and constantly growing."

 ERS_Two_Years_To_Modernity_desc:0 "Great progress is already underway with the revamped Central Siberian Plan, but both it and our nation are rather outdated. If we want to someday become a great economic power, we will need to modernize at an unprecedented speed. Our government will invest in both public and private enterprise with the goal of promoting rapid technological development as a part of the industrialization project. Let's see just how many patents our entrepreneurs can file over the next two years."

 ERS_Ad_Astra_desc:0 "Central Siberia has developed beyond the wildest dreams of even Boris Pasternak! The factories are more plentiful and well-run than ever, the people's spirits and work ethic are at an all-time high, and the economy runs smoothly enough that somehow both the workers and businessmen are satisfied. Sure, we still have problems as you do anywhere else, but Central Siberia has become a bastion of material success and happiness in a world which sorely lacks both of those things. We have reached the moon; now, to the stars!"

 ERS_Cultural_Shift_desc:0 "Tomsk, and now all of Central Siberia, has already made great material and spiritual gains. But why stop now? We've already proved that modernizing our industry and culture has seriously benefited our society, so why not get ahead of the curve with our social policy as well?\n\nIt'll be ambitious, but we can create a culture and set of laws that guarantee our society accepts every single person on an individual level. This means increasing the rights and opportunities of women; they should get the chance to study and work too! It also means protecting the rights of other groups even if it isn't popular. We'll legislate protections for ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities, and even more controversially, our LGBT+ population. If something is out of your control or part of your personal identity, you shouldn't be discriminated against for that. Let's make Central Siberia the most modern and progressive place in all of Russia."

 ERS_Raising_Children_desc:0 "Everyone in Central Siberia has the right to study and find a paying and fulfilling career... including women! Historically our culture has strongly pressured women to remain nothing but homemakers while men have enjoyed the freedom of pursuing their dreams (and cash to put food on the table).\n\nA free and universal childcare program will be introduced for all Central Siberian families, whether rich or poor, so that mothers have the same opportunities to learn and work as everyone else."

 ERS_The_Modern_Russian_Culture_desc:0 "Let's kick things up a notch and truly broaden our citizens' cultural horizons.\n\nWe've already modernized Russia's visual arts, theatre, and film scenes; why not encourage the rapidly evolving music industry, which is currently developing a new techno-electronic style popular with our younger population? Why not support new radio stations and hold music festivals? Let's upgrade our cuisine too! We can hold fairs and special markets featuring exotic foods, and demonstrating other nations' cultural traditions and celebrations to expose our people to a wide range of foreign experiences. The people of Central Siberia will be the most well-versed and culturally enlightened people in the world!"

 ERS_Rotating_Education_desc:0 "Part of the new, modern culture we want to instill in our people is a desire to learn and gain knowledge. So many hidden geniuses could be stuck performing menial labour for the rest of their lives because they have not had the proper educational opportunities provided to them.\n\nTo remedy this, we will initiate a rotating education program supported by both public and private institutions that will allow any worker who wants to do so attain an affordable higher education. We can always use more scientists, artists, teachers, politicians, and thinkers, but we can't expect the majority of those who live in Central Siberia to pursue these avenues without a little push."

 ERS_Republican_Vanguard_desc:0 "The Army is arguably the single most important apparatus of state. Not only does it protect the nation from outside threats, like the roving warbands of Russia or more organized hostile warlord states on our borders, but it also provides an important interior defense, defending the government from subversives within. These subversives may have any number of ill intentions; We know not why, only that they're there. They intend to subvert democracy for their own aims, whatever they may be. Only through the strengthening of the Army may we safeguard ourselves from these enemies, at home and abroad."

 ERS_Defensive_Doctrine_desc:0 "A declaration of war against our nation is simply the acknowledgement of a relationship our nations have already shared. There is no peace amongst the warlords of Russia, only prolonged truces. This is the mindset with which we must approach all our neighboring nations, be it during peacetime or war. Our nation will be impenetrable, whether to raids coming across the border during times of "peace" or to a full frontal assault during times of war. Every meter of land they take from us will demand thousands of their soldiers, just as every man we lose will demand ten more of theirs. We will make attacking our land as attractive a prospect as invading Germany might seem to Finland."

 ERS_Counterattack_Doctrine_desc:0 "Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength. Even if we can manage to kill an invading enemy at a rate of ten to one at all times, should we fail to seize the advantage and counterattack, we will inevitably lose. Enemy troops, fatigued by warfare, can be most effectively destroyed by rapid counter attacks by mobile forces. Their weakened troops won't stand a chance against the overwhelming speed and strength that our armoured vehicles and supporting mobile infantry can provide."

 ERS_Matryoshka_Preparations_desc:0 "You don't get to pick what bad things happen to you. An obvious statement, but pertinent nonetheless. At any hour, any or all of our enemies may choose to storm the border and go to war with us. We must be prepared for any and all situations that could come our way. Defensive lines upon defensive lines, counterattack plans for every possible nightmare scenario, a plan for every possible type of war that may come our way. It's far better to organize such plans now than to agonize without them later."

 ERS_Degrading_Enemy_Perforamance_desc:0 "One can't win a war hiding behind bunkers and clinging to WW1 artillery tactics. The French learned as much in the summer of 1940 when Paris first fel under occupation by the Germans. The war of the future will be fought with with highly specialized units suppported in the air on the front lines with CAS and behind them as well through strategic bombings, crippling the enemy's logistics. The enemy's units will hardly be able to put up a fight by the time our main army meets them on the battlefield should our elite forces and air wings be given the resources to do their jobs."

 ERS_Endless_Material_desc:0 "Material is cheaper than the lives of our elite army. We can use our vast industrial might as a shield for our troops on the front lines. Artillery shells will blot out the skies of our enemy as we obliterate advancing armies at a distance. And should these armies manage to get close enough to attack us, they will only be met by miles of concrete bunkers spraying out metric tons of lead each and every hour. Our nation's factories will put out concrete and steel until the whole of Russia is bled dry before succumbing to enemy invasion."

 ERS_To_The_Jugular_desc:0 "The German's named their tanks after panthers and tigers with good reason. Much like the fearsome feline predators, our tank's imposing speed and attack can rip through an enemy line with ease. We learned of their striking power years ago on the battlefields of the Eastern Front, and we've learned it here in the wastes of Russia again and again as we encounter ever larger and more industrialized foes. However, with our enemies bled dry of their equipment and manpower by the rest of our army, our tanks will know only decisive blows as we crush enemy resistance once and for all."

 ERS_Nothing_Is_Forgotten_desc:0 "Russia is not kind to governments that cannot feed the people. This is a lesson that the Tsar learned decades ago, as have many warlord governments since then. If the people are starving, then no amount of intelligence gathering in the world will feed them. Resources dedicated towards ensuring a continuous supply of grain, meats, and other foods will invariably go far further towards preventing the formation of a fifth column than an intelligence agency ever will. Only the most desperate turn to revolution to remedy their situation. If the people are never forced into such a situation, then there won't be any problems."

 ERS_All_Is_Known_desc:0 "Russian intelligence gathering operations are vital for our state's continued survival. Not only do such operations provide us with information on what our enemies are doing abroad, such as their planned invasion, technological developments, and political movements, but they also help to ensure domestic safety and stability at home. There are any number of agitators, dissidents and insurgents within our borders and even within our army that, should they be given the chance, would tear down everything we've created thus far. Our intelligence services must know everything to prevent such a thing from happening."

 ERS_We_Will_Bury_Them_desc:0 "Should our elite units in the army and the air force fail to subdue the enemy and our armies pushed back far into Tomsk, will will unleash our final weapon: concrete. Bunkers, miles upon miles of them spanning in every direction, blocking our enemies paths and corraling them into slaughterhouses of our own design. A wall of reinforced rebar unassailable by all but the heaviest and most powerful armored vehicles. More resources should be put towards our defense and securing our borders. If we can't drown them in bullets, we'll bury them in concrete."

A battle hardened democracy, ready to assume its title on the world stage. The Siberian Republic sets out into the wider world, confident in its abilities."

 ERS_Western_Outlook_desc:0 "Russia's destiny is inextricably intertwined with the west. The west is our homeland, the homeland of all Russians. It is no longer tolerable to allow German jackboots to tread on Russian soil. Preparations are to be made for the liberation of German occupied territories in Moscowien, Ukraine, Ostland, and Kaukasia. These lands are inherently Russian, and nothing less than their full return will be acceptable. The future awaits us in Europe, and although the great continent has fallen a long way since Russia was last a nation, we have nothing if not hope for its recovery."

 ERS_Eastern_Possibilities_desc:0 "Although Russia's ultimate goal is to reclaim her western territories lost in the Second World War, we mustn't disregard our former holdings in the east. Vladivostok is a wildly valuable prize for us, giving us not only a port in one of the fastest growing economic regions in all the world, but also access to lucrative American ports and markets. Additionally, those eastern holdings could further offer us an entrance into Asian politics, which we might use to our advantage in further dismantling the already ailing Co-Prosperity Sphere. In any event, we should be standing at the ready to seize on any opportunities that may arise to liberate the Russian Far East."

Our spies will infiltrate foreign governments, leaking a steady stream of state secrets which we will further the interests of our nation. Every effort should be made to acquire compromising information so that we might better influence leaders in these nations. It's only a matter of time before someone slips up and gives us a piece of information we can use."

 ERS_Central_Asian_Hinterland_desc:0 "Central asia is one of the few paths we have to the wider world. Not only will it allow us a path into the giant that is India, but it also provides us a buffer with German controlled Persia. It would be beneficial if we were to find allies or partners in the region with which we might share a mutual defense pact. Additionally, the expansion of our economy into Central Asian markets could make for some tidy profits on boths sides of the border. We should attempt to make contact with some Central Asian businessmen and see if they wouldn't be too opposed to establish trade relationships with us."

 ERS_Rising_Sun_desc:0 "Although Japan was never considered to be as great a threat to Russian sovereignty as Germany, they still remain one of the world's few superpowers and their Sphere shares with Russia one the longest borders of any nation on Earth. We should send some diplomats to Tokyo and see what exactly they think of us, and determine whether or not they are a threat. Perhaps, if our initial meetings go well, we may well even be able to set up an embassy and parlay our talks into greater discussions about Vladivostok and its potential future ownership."

 ERS_The_Failing_Eagle_desc:0 "Germany is a nation far gone. Years of economic failure and a recent civil war have made Germany into a shadow of what it once was, yet they remain one of the greatest threats to a reunified Russia's survival. Given that our republic has been fighting off warlords for several years, focusing mostly on day to day survival in Siberia, our knowledge on the specifics of Germany and the Pakt are rather limited. We must endeavor to learn as much as we can about the dying empire and its vassal states, as well as how we can exploit its weaknesses for our own gain."

 ERS_The_Bastille_Stands_desc:0 "The worker's revolt has come and gone, and we've managed to come out on top. With the revolt put down, hopefully for good, we should begin focusing on restarting the economy. The Central Siberian revolt destroyed a lot of economic infrastructure and forced us to shift the economy into a military oriented mode of production. Our efforts should be focused on shifting military production back into civilian production, and from there move to rebuild the damaged parts of our nation. What's important is that the Bastille stands. So long as it survives, the nation will move forward."

 ERS_Legacy_Of_The_Four_Year_Plan_desc:0 "Interestingly, some of our friends in the private sector have recently expressed interest in following up on the four year plans we implemented previously, though with an interesting slant. Instead of having the government build new factories and set higher quotas for state owned enterprises, our friends instead suggest that we instead invest those resources we'd put aside for that into the free market. The funds would be used to prop up new businesses in our nation and give it a boost after the destruction of recent wars and revolts."

 ERS_Exporting_Synthetic_Culture_desc:0 "What's to stop us from synthesizing a culture all our own? We control the state, and with that power we also gain the ability to influence the nation's culture, more specifically the worker's culture. Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to begin promoting Protestant style work ethic with Confusion obedience and Soviet worship of industry. Indeed, we should hope that such encouragement of this synthetic culture will bring about more productivity amongst our citizens and work to further increase the efficiency of the state."

 ERS_Legacy_Of_The_Three_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The bureaucrats in our government are working diligently to design our next three year plan to further develop the economy. While convincing arguments have been made in favor of investing government resources into furthering the free market as opposed to the centralized economic apparatus we currently maintain, we are of the position that until Russia is unified under one government, state control of vital industries like the military industrial complex is necessary. When our nation is safe from the constant threat of invasion it currently languishes under we might consider privatizing some industry and opening up the markets, but until then the centrally planned economy will remain."

 ERS_Convert_Friendly_Unions_desc:0 "There are a variety of independent unions operating in several sectors of the economy in our country. From steelworking to transportation to agriculture, there's a union for it. These unions are disparate and limited in their bargaining power. As part of our domestic policy, we have begun pushing for larger state run unions to organize and control the various local unions being run across the country, which would help to strengthen the worker's cause overall. Though there are many unions that reject the idea wholeheartedly, there are others that have been swayed by the arguments of a national union backed by the government and supported by government funds. We should endear ourselves to these unions and encourage them to join."

 ERS_Making_Use_Of_Dirigiste_desc:0 "The new lands and territories we've acquired in recent years are vast, and brimming with people. Organizing and ruling over these lands with our current administration is proving greatly problematic. Not only is our staff too limited to handle the paperwork and bureaucratic load these lands have put on our shoulders, but we are also finding that the new bureaucrats we have managed to bring on board to manage these lands have been entirely incompetent. There are many former leaders and bureaucrats from the warlord governments we previously conquered with the experience and intelligence needed to effectively administer our new territories. We should seek them out and bring them on board. If nothing else, it should help us to better integrate these new territories, by offering them leaders of their own people."

 ERS_Learning_From_Foreign_Corporations_desc:0 "The unification of our region of Russia has brought about an economic boom. The peace and stability we've brought to our homelands has improved investor's faith in the economy and has encouraged young entrepreneurs to begin building their own companies. These new companies are going to be competing with foreign corporations with stronger logistics, better management, and lower production costs. If our domestic companies are to survive, they will need to emulate these foreign corporations in everything mentioned before. We will not become another market to exploit."

 ERS_Tailor_Welfare_Net_desc:0 "The government only has so many resources, and although we'd love to be able to support everybody, choices must be made concerning who gets what and how much they get. A new administrative welfare body has been assembled to assist us in that regard. It will aid us in determining what populations have the greatest need for aid, and what form that aid will take. In some cases, a financial stimulus is needed to lift a region out of poverty, and in others, it might be the construction of new soup kitchens and homeless shelters. By targeting exactly what is needed in our varied population, we will maximise efficiency and quality of life."

 ERS_Stamping_Out_Dangerous_Ideologies_desc:0 "While an educated, conscious, and politically free citizenry is important for any good democracy, there must be limits as to the ideologies we allow to operate within the country. Dangerous ideologies like Marxism and Fascism led to the oppression and murder of millions. These ideologies have served as a net negative for society and have actively worked to bring humanity backwards. It would be both irresponsible and careless to allow such ideologies to manifest themselves within our populace, and steps should be taken to ensure such a situation never occurs."

 ERS_Expanding_Our_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Our republic is growing and changing at a rapid rate, and our bureaucracy needs to get bigger if we are to handle it. We recently quadrupled our population during the reunification of Central Siberia, increasing the need for bureaucrats that can manage these new peoples, and have also been implementing more encompassing welfare and labour policies which will require a larger bureaucracy to run and operate. As the republic grows, so too must we if we are to sate the administrative and logistical needs of this nation."

 ERS_The_Expanded_Trinity_Association_desc:0 "The Bastilliards are, and have always been, a hub of thinkers and industrial planners. A sense for the practical paired with a little idealism can go a long ways towards making what might seem like dreams into reality, and what dreams we've had. We've brought our republic from a weak warlord state of the fringes of Siberia into one of the foremost contenders for Russian dominance, and people have taken note. All manner of thinkers and highly skilled professionals have flocked to the party of rationality and intellectualism. The Bastilliards have become the golden standard for how a government should be run in Russia."

 ERS_humanist_the_pacific_shores_desc:0 "Now that we have unified the Far East and Central Siberia, we are no longer fenced in. Our Republic stretches from Lake Baikal to the Pacific, and now we can finally start to begin trade with the outside world more easily. Our economy itself shall grow due these newfound advantages such as the Port of Magadan and Vladivostok.\n\nWith these ports under a unified republic that has consolidated its power, we can begin to expand our knowledge of the world. We can also begin to contact the great powers of the world such as the United States, the leader of the free world and the OFN. Possible trade ties could begin between our nation and theirs benefiting us both at the end of the day. Our nation can finally throw off its shackles of being far from the sea and the world."
 ERS_humanist_uprooting_dogmatic_marxism_desc:0 "Marx himself was yet one socialist thinker, one that was too self centered onto himself and his teachings. While his methods and ideals have influenced us to an extent, the idea of dictatorship of the proletariat has no place in our society. One of the recently conquered states that we had liberated and brought into the fold has influenced from a Marxist society, we need to remove these influences.The state had gone through a civil war due to differences in the Marxist belief.\n\nTo some of the more extreme members of our country, this could be seen as an overreach by us. However this is nothing more than curing a virus that had stained Russia for many generations. Once we do remove his influence from the Far East, stability can take the place that these ideals had held in the people. The people may seem callous at first, but then should be more accepting once they realize the good we have done."
 ERS_humanist_expanding_worker_democracy_desc:0 "Workers are the lifeblood of our society. Our rule in Central Siberia was quite focused on the idea of helping the workers instead of oppressing them like the former rulers of Russia. Unlike the former Union, we have placed the utmost importance on protecting them with labor laws and unions. However, when it comes to the Far East, the lands that had been formerly ruled by a group of men called the "Heirs of Harbin" and the dogmatic Father, worker democracy is a non existent idea. We need to change this.\n\nMany of the former workers in this region had lived under the oppressive yoke of men who like to call themselves rulers while they couldn't give a single bit of pity to the man keeping the country afloat from his labor. We must take these old ideas and morals and toss them out. In our society, there is no place for this. It must be our goal to develop worker democracy in these regions for the future."
 ERS_humanist_advancing_our_projects_desc:0 "Before we had the power and the opportunity to reunite the east, we had far fetched plans that would help the region as a whole with great economic benefits, now that we have the resources and reach of the Far East. It seems that an industrial base was constructed by the former denizens of the region, but we can always improve on this. The Central Siberian Plan, while helping our region Siberia, the east was much more neglected by these plans.\n\nAlong with these advancements in technology and our project, we can also begin reforms in the many cities and regions we have under our control, such as Magadan and Buryatia. They had been exposed to extremist methods such as Leninism and Facism. We must reform these regions to guarantee a hopeful future."
 ERS_humanist_the_peoples_war_desc:0 "While some of the more advanced and developed nations may disagree with the idea of a mass citizen army, if we can train these reserves and the main army enough, they will turn into a formidable force. Some of our political opponents have opposed this idea due to the risk of an uprising possibly or even a stunning defeat caused by a much better trained opponent. However, this would be unlikely after our training regime has gone through.\n\nWe are beginning to acquire books from the West on military tactics and battle plans, using these we have begun to adapt them to the conditions of Central and East Siberia to help us win our wars. Along with this, we have planned to introduce new equipment that we have also shipped to us from the West using our newfound ports in Magadan."
 ERS_humanist_the_peoples_education_desc:0 "Education is the backbone of a successful country and society. While many of the more developed countries in the world agree on this idea, some in Russia had been opposed to this idea in the time after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Before the Central Siberian War, we had preached the idea of higher education through our universities, but since we had regressed the idea in Central Siberia had disappeared while in the Far East it was nothing more than a dream.\n\nNow that we have control over Central Siberia once again, and now the Far East, we can implement our education reforms. While some of our other reforms may have caused rifts between the Salons, this would be one seen as a quadripartite effort between us. While the salons may have ideological differences, we can all agree on education."
 ERS_humanist_the_workers_economy_desc:0 "The Central Siberia Plan was a decisive action planned and executed by the General Secretary of the Soviet Union at the time, Nikolai Bukharin. The plan was to build factories and to reform the industry of Central Siberia. It had made us extremely strong during the post Union years, however due to the breakup of Central Siberia, we had lost quite a large base of our industry. We can began to rebuild these factories now we have control of them once again and now we can spread this plan to the Far East.\n\nAs we build these factories, many of them will be worker co-ops. As these factories will be owned by the workers themselves, who will vote on the many decisions that pass through them. This will in turn, make the factories more efficient and the workers more complacent due to them running the factory and not an issue of the state."
 ERS_humanist_the_grand_humanist_conference_desc:0 "It appears that it is time for us to pool together our great minds of the Humanists into one convention. Unlike many of the other official meetings we have held over the years, this one will encompass the entire country and we will be met with thousands of new members to the Humanist cause and even more returning ones from past conferences.\n\nUnlike many of the other ones, which had focused on our ambitions to rise to power in Tomsk, this one will highlight our current height of power and how we will expand upon these ideas. The central idea of this conference will be the expansion of the Central Siberian Plan, we will also announce our project that will modernize Eastern Russia. However, in this time, we also have been needing ideas for a project that all of the other contenders to unify the country would want. We are planning on asking many of the Humanists who come to the conference to pitch their ideas to use in these matters."
 ERS_humanist_the_tomsibar_plan_desc:0 "It is finally time for us to reveal our plan that we had made during the Grand Humanist Conference to the world. The name of it is the TomsiBar Plan and it aims to modernize Central Siberia very quickly.\n\nSome of the other salons will call us a hive of madmen for even thinking of this plan, however we are optimistic. The plan calls for three things. One is the development of "Hypertrains" these trains will use a type of engineering that was pioneered in Japan during the past few years. They will connect most of Central Siberia, turning it into a very connected region and modernizing it. The second is the increased connection of the many cities dotting the region, building more and more in between them to foster connection. The third and final phase, is the merging of the many cities into one "Megacity" that will serve as the capital of our country. This plan if completed, shall serve as the envy of the many countries around the world."
 ERS_humanist_the_capillaries_desc:0 "It's hard for us to claim to be interested in the wellbeing of our people when our cities barely provide for our people.\n\nInfrastructure within the few urban centers we have are a mess. The collapse of the CSR, infighting, and decay have all taken a toll on public services and roads. First things first, though. We need to repair and build seriously damaged and unusable streets so people can use them again. Whatever rail-ines, trains, and buses that are still salvageable should be pressed into service for the public, and for God's sake, someone get the water running everywhere?! Citizens living in the suburbs of our cities deserve functioning infrastructure like any other urban dweller."
 ERS_humanist_the_arteries_desc:0 "While local infrastructure needs a momental amount of improvements and work, we can not afford to neglect the major transportation links between our scattered towns and cities if the TomSiBar plan is to succeed.\n\nThe most efficient mode of transporting goods such long distances is by far by railines. We should make the investments and take the time to rebuild, repair, and place new lines so that all of Tomsk is connected. Improving our links will not only be great for the economy, but will also be vital for our armies; the lines will be of the utmost importance for moving our military across our state in good time."
 ERS_humanist_the_main_organs_desc:0 "The cities of Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Barnaul are currently our main centers of population and production. While they are the most developed regions in our state, compared to modern standards, the cities are archaic. Novosibirsk and Barnaul also remain some of the greatest beds of resentment against Tomsk's government\n\nWe need to desperately improve living conditions, industry, infrastructure, and human services in all three of these urban centers. The cities are too important to neglect, and their true potential makes them attract places to invest in."
 ERS_humanist_to_the_west_desc:0 "While we have successfully unified one half of Russia, another half remains under control by a separate nation who has fancied themselves a potential rival and even enemy if it truly comes to war.\n\nOur country must prepare for war, if it is truly needed. While we may not want to fight a potentially stronger opponent, we must make sure that we can stand up to them. However, if there is a chance we must prepare to have diplomatic contact with the nation in the west. We should consider all of our diplomatic options before even thinking about the option of total war. However, we must be prepared for this at all costs. Luckily, due to our ports that we now have under our control, we can finally import new weapons that are more efficient and more durable. The harsh winter in Siberia could be an issue if we must fight in it, so our soldiers and their weapons must be hardened for the fight. At all costs we must survive, but we should attempt the diplomatic route."
 ERS_humanist_neutrality_to_the_sphere_desc:0 "When it comes to the many superpowers of the world, there are three major ones. The Germans and their Unity-Pakt, what we can not join obviously enough. The second is the United States and the Organization of Free Nations. While they are the champion of the free world and many of our literature and other supplies come from them, they do not officially recognize us. However we can remain neutral with them.\n\nThe last great superpower of the world is Japan and their Co-Prosperity Sphere. While it seems that their power per day seems to be falling, they are our closest superpower. However, they seem quite fine with zero interaction with us or any of the conquered warlord states. While we may not agree with any of their policies, they will still acknowledge and trade with us, less officially like the OFN. Maybe we should not pledge our allegiance to either, but instead be neutral to them. This should hopefully make us more viable for new trade agreements."
 ERS_humanist_science_of_the_free_world_desc:0 "Due to Tomsk being relatively unscathed from the West Russian War and even the Central Siberian War in some places, we have our universities stand proud. However, like most things in Eastern Siberia, they could always be better.\n\nNow that we have ocean access, we can start to send letters to the many great universities of the free world. Places such as Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, McGill, all of them. Hopefully, if the students and administrators of these universities listen to our letters, they can start to send some of their knowledge they have in the many fields of science. Fields such as medicine, engineering, technology and industrial development. All of these fields would help develop our country further, in exchange, many of their students would be able to come over to Tomsk to help us develop one of our projects. If they wanted to, of course."
 ERS_humanist_russian_determination_desc:0 "Our armed forces must be prepared for anything. While we may not have the mechanized divisions like many of the other more advanced powers of the world, we have something they do not. Determined people who are willing to become soldiers to protect their home, and who are well trained. While much of our army is a mix of professional soldiers and worker units who could be raised if needed, we should train all of them more hard. We must be able to hold on against the onslaught of an invasion if possible to make sure that we can issue more men and women into our forces to be ready for battle. Due to this, our worker units will be reforged as a national guard type army. This army will live most of their lives as workers in our country, only training for one week per month or so. However, if our country is ever in a war, they shall be activated as a full combat unit and must be prepared to fight."
 ERS_humanist_heirs_to_1917_heirs_to_1918_desc:0 "Tomsk is a paradise in the Russian wastes. No other state cares for its people like us; our workers; men, women, and children are not disposable resources to be thrown away in pointless border skirmishes or raids. Our people are our future, and they should have a say in government. Tomsk and her people are one and the same; we must all work together to build ourselves a better tomorrow!"

 ERS_modernist_o_brave_new_world_desc:0 "We've reached the Pacific Ocean! A brave new world stands across the horizon. No longer landlocked, we have access to the far east's ports. Trading will be much easier now, so we should prioritize our relationship with the Pacific powers. We will need as much aid as possible for our plans, we cannot fall behind the West.\n\nAccessing our newly gained resources will also be very important for our growing economy. Extracting these resources for our industries will be needed if we want to compete with our neighbor to the west and finally bring Russia out of the past."

 ERS_modernist_integrate_new_assets_desc:0 "With our annexation of the Far East more industries, businesses, and people are now under our control. We need to take advantage of these to expand our economy and fully develop Siberia. Expanding firms and integrating them into our economy will surely give a boost to our GDP, which is necessary if we want Siberia to appear as a modern nation.\n\nUsing the Far East's industry, while limited, will be necessary if we want to compete with the industrialized West. Meanwhile, giving the people better jobs and eliminating the more useless ones should create a more efficient system and make the population more satisfied."

 ERS_modernist_decontaminate_the_land_desc:0 "Fanaticism and radical ideologies dominated the Far East in the Warlord Era and under the Far Eastern Regional Government. These ways of thought continue to affect our control over the Far East, as many people do not support the ways of democracy.\n\nWe must work on diminishing fascism, socialism, and despotism to empower our rule in the region, ensuring support for our government. Educating the populace on the benefits of republicanism and democracy has to be done, no matter what some in the duma may say."

 ERS_modernist_stars_and_stripes_desc:0 "America is one of the few more powerful democracies on this planet. We have many reasons to align towards them, our political systems are similar, we share the same enemies, and both of our nations have fought to spread democracy. Their science base is also significantly powerful, with inventions and technological developments that surpass the world.\n\nFor all these reasons, we must ask America for aid! Our economy, science base, and military could all use American help. America must be on our side in the future, we don't know what conflicts lie ahead."

 ERS_modernist_all_that_weve_missed_desc:0 "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, innovation became a thing of the past. The only technological developments pertained to the military. Now that we have brought stability and democracy to Siberia, it's time we read up on the twenty years of science we missed. There is a lot to learn, and much of it can be used to improve the lives of the people.\n\nIn particular, developments in computer technology have gained the interest of our scientists. We need all the modern technology we can get our hands-on. If we do, we will far surpass any other backward nation in Russia."

 ERS_modernist_a_new_sibplan_desc:0 "The Russian Republic exists in the remains of Bukharin's Central Siberian Plan. The industrial development of the past allowed us to further expand Central Siberian infrastructure and cities. Now, however, it's time we begin the next phase of the plan.\n\nElectronics are the technology of the modern age. Our government has decided to create a city working towards the development of new technologies. Computers, telephones, radios, and even televisions could be designed and built in Russia! If there is a way to bring Russia into the modern age, it's technology!"

 ERS_modernist_theoretical_computer_science_desc:0 "Siberia has a plentitude of universities, its time they study electronics. Everything has to be taught, the assembly, programming, even theoretical sciences. Our scientists, professors, and researchers will have to work as hard as possible if we want to make Siberia into a center of technology for the world.\n\nIf all goes as planned, new electronics will be invented and discontinued within days. Each development will propel us further into the future, an age where everything is electronic."

 ERS_modernist_business_effort_desc:0 "If we want a chance at creating a Siberian electronic powerhouse, not everything can be done by the government. The private sector will be our most useful ally, with private companies competing with each other to create the best electronics Russia can come up with.\n\nHowever, we may have to help these private companies start up, planting the seeds if you will. Grants will be given to these new companies working in the computer and electronic fields. Hopefully, we should soon see some progress."

 ERS_modernist_importing_foreign_computers_desc:0 "Russia cannot develop reliable and well-functioning computers and electronics on its own. To give us a base to work with we will begin importing Sphere and American computers to figure out how they work and reverse engineer them.\n\nThis will give our engineers and theorists much-needed ideas to build and invent better computers. If all goes as planned, our computer scientists will be able to improve on American and Japanese designs, paving the way towards innovation."

 ERS_modernist_new_architectures_desc:0 "Vacuum tubes are good for computers, but they now seem to be a thing of the past. New, silicon chips are smaller and faster, allowing for even more advanced computer technology.\n\nA future for silicon chips in computer processors seems to be the way forward. We should experiment with silicon chips, perhaps our theorists or scientists could create an even better design! If not, we will still be able to prove the benefits of silicon circuits over vacuum tubes."

 ERS_modernist_the_city_of_lights_desc:0 "Our project has entered its stage of completion, and we are nearly ready to unveil our project. What once was Kemerovo has changed significantly, and its transformation into the City of Lights has taken great effort.\n\nTurning an industrial town into a modern Russian Silicon Valley will hopefully have fulfilled the dreams of our Modernist government. Surely the work of countless individuals will be fully realized?"

 ERS_modernist_a_cutting_edge_military_desc:0 "Integrating these new ideas into future military equipment is a necessity. A technologically advanced military is a powerful military, and we need the best of the best if we want to win over our western rival and Germany.\n\nElectronics can be incorporated into tanks, planes, trucks, AFVs, and even support equipment. The best counter for a larger enemy is better technology. Their tanks and guns will be no match for ours!"

 ERS_modernist_financial_markets_desc:0 "Progress towards a Russian electronic powerhouse is steady but slow. Many companies working towards new inventions and developments for computers often find themselves low on cash necessary to continue their work.\n\nTheir failure means our failure. If we want to solve the funding issue, we have to funnel in more financial investments. Grants, donations, anything to get better results. As much money as possible must be pumped into developing electronics."

 ERS_modernist_west_where_we_must_return_desc:0 "The reunification of Russia is nearing, and we have to be ready for it. More men must be trained and deployed to the field, and our army size has to increase. A front against the west will be a large one, and we cannot allow any holes in our lines to appear. Deploying the army to the western border will guarantee our security in case of war, and will show our rival our might.\n\nAlthough, war may not be necessary. We should probably start off with negotiations before we prepare for any attack. Perhaps the West may be more willing to unify peacefully?"

 ERS_modernist_my_dolzhny_znat_my_budem_znat_desc:0 "We must know, we will know. Our republic has grown in the last decade. From a city to half a country we have so far brought democracy and freedom to the depths of this wasteland in which we reside. Our republic will only continue to expand until we have regained all of Russia, restoring liberty and democracy to what once was a land of darkness and despair.\n\nProgress and modernity are also within our reach, as new technologies are spread across Russia and people are brought out of their misery to thrive. All across Siberia hope, progress, and science are on the march. Let us bring it West."

 ERS_decembrist_once_more_to_the_pacific_desc:0 "Our Russian military forces have given us the gracious gift of a coastal border. This new gateway to the Pacific Ocean means that we are no longer restricted to diplomacy and trade within Russia. With a proper navy and merchant marine, we can finally extend a hand to the rest of the world. Many of our foreign diplomats and merchants are excited for the opportunity to finally connect with other world powers once more, and we will be looking to establish trade with outside nations as well."
 ERS_decembrist_the_lost_sheep_desc:0 "The military victories that we achieved in the Far East left many peasants without their leader, Father Men. Their anger at being abandoned and exploited by unscrupulous tyrants is understandable. To stabilize the situation we must first calm their anger. We can pacify Men's followers by leading them to our Eastern Orthodox churches and slowly assimilating them into our society, though it is their decision whether or not to participate in church. Nevertheless, we cannot allow the radical teachings of Men to bleed through into our great society."
 ERS_decembrist_the_wretches_of_harbin_desc:0 "Warlords that rose up around the city of Harbin harbored a dangerous ideology, one that cannot exist in our democratic system. It is now our job to clear the Fascists that once lived in Amur and Magadan to ensure the safety of our republic. In its place we will plant seeds of hope and prosperity, and we will lift up those who were persecuted by the Fascist regimes that once spanned the Far East."
 ERS_decembrist_last_of_the_reds_desc:0 "Our conquest of the Russian Far East may have granted us access to the outside world, but many radical Communists still remain in the region. These men are living remnants of the former Soviet Union, whose NKVD officers purged many of Russia's intellectuals before and during the German-Soviet War. We shall give these men no remorse just like they gave our intellectual friends no remorse; we must eradicate any shred of Communism remaining in the Russian Far East."
 ERS_decembrist_the_great_discord_desc:0 "Much of Pasternak's salon-based republic remains stained by political strife between different parties. For our nation to progress, we must decide how to integrate the various political parties in order to reduce turmoil and produce a more unified government. In this way, we will end the confusion and step together in harmony."
 ERS_decembrist_the_militarist_and_the_silovik_desc:0 "Many citizens of conquered Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk territory are still loudly patriotic for their former countries. While this can be accepted in our society, we must search the population for any militant separatists who could inflict harm on our people. To benefit the peaceful residents, we must encourage them to remain patriotic of their states while cracking down on the more violent, rebellious inhabitants."
 ERS_decembrist_new_business_desc:0 "All of the lands that have just been reintegrated into our republic have vast economic opportunities and industry under the control of industrialists and businessmen which have also recently become citizens of the republic. If we so choose, we have the power to act decisively and bolster our already growing industrial base by having a few chats with some of these entrepreneurs.\n\nOf course, doing so may help to illustrate the ridiculous narrative that we care more about factories and natural resources than we do about the political and material interests of our people, and we might be better off continuing to fight off the cynicism that pursuing reckless economic progress creates in the first place."
 ERS_decembrist_idealizing_the_center_desc:0 "Our end goal is to ultimately integrate everyone (within reason) into our political system. Independents of nearly all stripes should be encouraged to share their ideas and wishes not as outsiders, but with the Salon which most closely matches their personal ideology.\n\nWhile we cannot expect every single person to sort themselves cookie-cutter style into a Salon in an instant, (and we can of course encourage some people to focus on things other than politics) we can definitely help people voice their grievances in a manner where they will actually be heard and where we will more readily be able to respond. It's a matter of practicality for us and for them."
 ERS_decembrist_a_new_school_of_thought_desc:0 "As a means of further integrating all sorts of people into our political system, we should encourage the formation and growth of new political philosophies at our universities and all across our realm with the ultimate aim of guiding these unique thinkers into one of our four Salons.\n\nEssentially, by both allowing and advocating for individuals to voice their own political thoughts, while simultaneously directing them subtly towards our existing system, we can strike a perfect balance; we'll demonstrate our flexibility and  desire to listen to the people's will while still maintaining the status quo at the end of the day."
 ERS_decembrist_the_fractured_left_desc:0 "Soviets, anarchists, and assorted radical socialists alike all heavily populate some of our newly conquered territories. We are no fans of them. Or rather, we are opposed to their beliefs; hate the sin, love the sinner...\n\nStill, these misguided people are now our citizens and if we hope to integrate them into our Salon system and resolve this godforsaken political crisis, we at the very least need to hear what their grievances are and look like we are taking their wishes into account. Our Salons should be a place where people of all beliefs and all walks of life should be able to have their say, these folk are, unfortunately, no exception."
 ERS_decembrist_the_counter_reformation_desc:0 "Supporters of the ideas of Marx, Yagoda, and Sablin are all the same. Well, they're not literally the same, but for our purposes we can treat them as such.\n\nSocialism and communism are massive, grandiose ideologies that span a vast array of theories and ideals, and thinkers like Marx are just ordinary people like you and I. We can try and tame some of these radicals a bit and push them towards the Humanists' camp and away from damaging goals like revolution. While we are remiss to be directly supporting a rival Salon, doing so is decidedly preferable to allowing a bunch of leftists from collapsing our Salon system altogether."
 ERS_decembrist_forging_ahead_alone_desc:0 "The Decembrists were the ones who transformed a measly Tomsk into a strong and powerful (almost) Russia. We've already taken our republic this far, industrializing, reconquering, policymaking, developing our people's culture. Without our hard work and uniquely effective ideology and philosophy, we would be nothing. There is simply no time and no reason to ask the other Salons for assistance as we continue to move forward and put an end to the nation's political crisis. After all, we are the only Salon that is well and truly in touch with the wants, needs, and feelings of the Russian people."
 ERS_decembrist_the_great_symposium_desc:0 "A Salon system is no system at all without the input of dissenting ideas and collaboration from people of all different perspectives. We are going to fix the political mess we're in, but we're going to do it the right way: working together will all of the Salons to finally integrate everyone into our political machine.\n\nThe Humanists, Bastillards, and Modernists all have a role to play in definitively convincing the people that our way of running things is for the best. Not everyone wants or has to be a Decembrist, and we have come to a point where we can accept that for the good of Russia."
 ERS_decembrist_a_new_era_for_the_republic_desc:0 "The wave of political independents and cynicism has been a pain in our rear ends for a damn long time by now. But at long last, after many months of intense campaigning and hard work, our Great Discord Project has come to an end. After announcing this to all of Russia, we shall see how we fared in our efforts."
 ERS_decembrist_expand_the_eastern_economy_desc:0 "A new channel to the Pacific has opened for us, and it is time to extend our free market economy to the easternmost border. We must develop these lands just like we developed our original states, by building factories and starting new supply chains. There is plenty of potential to be found in these new eastern provinces, and we must treat both man and nature with respect as we bolster the regional economy."
 ERS_decembrist_arms_for_the_soldiers_desc:0 "Our newly-conquered eastern lands and our Pacific border could be beneficial to our military development. We should use part of the acquired eastern resources to construct weapons for our liberation army. Now that we have a post on the Pacific, we can visit the outside world and discover new methods to develop stronger weapons, and who knows, we might be able to return with patents of our own."
 ERS_decembrist_bread_for_the_homefront_desc:0 "We are always in need of more food for our people, and it is imperative that we improve the current food situation in the conquered Far East. We shall work to expand our farms to the region, produce more farming tools, and import food from other world markets to ensure that our citizens are fed and healthy."
 ERS_decembrist_a_visit_to_uncle_sam_desc:0 "Our entire governmental system was partly influenced by that of the United States, and many in our population look to the Americans as a true savior of democracy, a beacon of hope for the world. Now that we have expanded our influence to a large part of Russia, we have the opportunity to send our leaders to the United States. This is currently our best chance to establish a friendship with the Americans, and they may be able to assist us in creating a democratic Russian state."
 ERS_decembrist_a_new_far_eastern_fleet_desc:0 "Our expansion into Pacific territory requires us to gather whatever we have into a ragtag navy capable of ensuring our naval supply routes and defending our coast from invaders. We might be able to salvage what was left of the former Soviet navy or old warlord-era ships that remained in good condition. It would be our first step towards developing a competent Russian navy to patrol our coasts."
 ERS_decembrist_the_great_federation_desc:0 "Yes! We are inches away from being the one and only Russian Republic, but there is reason to celebrate even before the reunification is finalized. We're in a very strong position to be the nation doing the aforementioned reunifying, as our political crisis is at an end and we have developed the means to stand alone as a geopolitical force in our own right.\n\nWe have shown the world the light and power of democracy as we promised, and it is now time to spread freedom to all and drop bombs and roll tanks upon the tyrants of the world! For Russia, and for democracy!"

Our prospects of victory have greatly increased, and we have shown the world we are truly a major force in Russia. Finally no longer landlocked, we can begin to orchestrate trade across the ocean and finally bring foreign riches into Siberia.\n\nThis is a major achievement for the Bastillards especially. Our plan of free trade across the Pacific is finally possible. We have not just brought democracy to the Far East, but great wealth as well!"
 ERS_bastillard_harbins_dark_legacy_desc:0 "The legacy of communism is especially seen in Irkutsk and Buryatia. It is the Bastillard's duty to remove these red stains and ensure supplies can move freely between our ports and cities. Partisans and resistance movements must be snuffed out as quickly as possible before they spread and gain strength. Once we stabilize our control, we will be able to enact our plans. No bandit will reach our trade routes!"
 ERS_bastillard_the_red_hinterland_desc:0 "Harbin has a dark legacy in the Far East. The center of Russian Fascism, groups thronged into Russia to destabilize it and enslave the Russian people. Fascism must be removed from the Far East, we cannot allow radical ideologies to tarnish our republic. Eliminating fascism from Outer Manchuria will also secure the ports, as we cannot have fascist resistance hurting our business efforts. \n\nIt is also important we conduct business in Harbin, as we must have ties with Japan so we do not rival them into the Pacific. A neutral relationship will be the best."
 ERS_bastillard_any_port_in_a_storm_desc:0 "Magadan is our only lifeline to the outside world, being the only major port under our control in the Far East. We must build more roads, more bridges, and more railways if we want Magadan to be as effective as possible, able to transport goods and trade at a faster pace. Upgrading the port itself by building more docks and using new technologies will also be necessary if we want Magadan to be useful."
 ERS_bastillard_but_this_one_desc:0 "Even with our improvements to Magadan, the port will never be as good as Vladivostok or any other port in outer Manchuria. To get a more robust trade network with the outside world we must expand our diplomacy and political strength. The negotiations will be difficult, but failure could jeopardize our entire economy."
 ERS_bastillard_the_new_pacific_policy_desc:0 "To bring our project up off the ground a new Ministry will be created to oversee it, integrated into the government. Named the Ministry of Trade and Defense, it will focus solely on trade operations in the Far East and the Pacific as well as the defense of convoys and trade lines. Funding this new ministry will hopefully bring the right people to the table and progress our plans."
 ERS_bastillard_american_trade_desc:0 "Trade with America is absolutely critical if we want to have a strong economy. We will ask them to trade in Magadan, and while they may not like conducting trade in a port that is frozen half the year, perhaps giving them a bit more will pique their interest. Perhaps special treatment in our economy will do the trick."
 ERS_bastillard_open_the_port_by_any_means_desc:0 ""
 ERS_bastillard_japanese_bargains_desc:0 "Japan now holds our old port of Vladivostok, which once was one of the best trading hubs in the Empire. We must ask them if we can make use of the port to trade and transport our goods. We could also request access to Manchurian railways which would give us the ability to send goods overland faster."
 ERS_bastillard_the_special_economic_zones_desc:0 "Manchuria may not be the best place to operate, but it is better than the Far East. Nevertheless, if we put our industries near the ports, the transportation of goods will go much faster and our economy will undoubtedly grow."
 ERS_bastillard_breaking_the_salon_deadlock_desc:0 "Dealing with Japan has proven very unpopular with both the citizens of the Republic and most of the Salons. However, there are those within one other salon that do understand our motives, the Humanists. Aligning ourselves with the Humanist salon should hopefully give us the majority to pass all the necessary policies dealing with America and Japanese trade."
 ERS_bastillard_preparing_the_western_positions_desc:0 "We must be ready for war in the west. While the government there may perhaps be willing to negotiate with us, it is much better to be safe by preparing for war. Developing local areas along the border and planning future campaigns must be done now before it may be too late."
 ERS_bastillard_expand_the_welfare_state_desc:0 "With our economy growing, we can accommodate better social welfare and civilian oriented policies. Let's focus on this to satisfy the everyday citizens, as it will act as an outflow for anger against our government."
 ERS_bastillard_a_final_round_of_preparations_desc:0 "Conflict is nearing, and we have to be prepared. Men must be trained, better weapons must be distributed, and a propaganda campaign must be completed. This will be our most challenging fight yet. We cannot lose if we wish for democracy to survive!"
 ERS_bastillard_the_west_will_be_ours_desc:0 "To the West, Russians toil underneath our rival. Beyond that, the horror of RK Moscowien, where Russians die under the boot of the Germans. We will win in the West, liberating all Russians, and the Iron Republic of the Bastillards will march to the gates of the Reich!"

Even with the influx of displaced old believers from western Russia, the tiny nation would struggle to field more than a few regiments of regular infantry. Beyond discussion of staging points for the invasion and a schedule aimed to acclimatize troops to mountain air, the military plan mostly discussed cultural issues tied to the occupation and how best to avoid making the locals feel as though their way of life is threatened.\n\nThe region had long been poor and semi-autonomous from the Central Siberian government. Local Burkhanists, follower of a turkic faith, had complained to the government about the arrival of thousands of old believer refugees from the west. The ever marginalized christian group had apparently decided on settling in a remote location for their own safety. Local tensions had been an issue, but not a critical one.

Reports often showed that many workers were regularly offering to do overtime, citizens went out into the community every week to collect trash and clean up, and the number of military recruits had steadily increased as more people acknowledged the need to and Tomsk's newfound ability to pacify the separatists across Central Siberia.\n\nIndeed, Kharms felt that Tomsk was almost ready to reclaim all of the Central Siberian Republic's territory, and that the military would be more capable of handling a worker uprising than it was before. Everything seemed to be falling into place perfectly, and so Kharms allowed himself to feel a great deal of self-satisfaction. A New Central Siberia was emerging."

This process would continue as Oyrotia took back its place within a new Republic. The only difference was that, hopefully, war would not visit the autonomous province in the foreseeable future.

The cosmonauts face many dangerous challenges such as meteorites, carnivorous plants, dangerous aliens, and deadly diseases. The end of the book reveals an extraordinary plot twist that takes both everyday readers and accomplished critics by surprise.\n\nThe book is widely believed to be influenced by the ideas of major Russian cosmist thinkers such as Alexander Bogdanov and Nikolai Federov. Kazantsev has confirmed he was inspired by these ideas and did include them in his novel.\n\nThe concepts of Cosmism primarily include the ideas of a new, almost utopian world, one where humanity would have free reign in space with the ability to acquire an infinite amount of resources. Cosmism also focuses not just on science and technology, but also on culture and natural philosophy. Cosmism even includes ideas of bringing the dead back to life and the achievement of human immortality. This Russian philosophical current has gained much-renewed interest in Tomsk with the rise of the Modernist Salon, and its ideals of a well ran free society that values knowledge. "\n\nWhile the book has its share of detractors, it's fiercer critics slamming it for being scientifically impossible, many people both young and old are complimenting the book for its many twists and thrilling writing. While it may be popular in Tomsk, it, unfortunately, has not seen much popularity beyond the republic's borders. It seems not many people are not up to purchasing and reading books in Warlord Russia.

Recapturing the region with the much diminished Republican Army would have been the height of folly. Some of the CSR's best troops had gone east with Krylov, and those men that had not left for Krasnoyarsk soon formed the core of Krylov's new royal army.\n\nNow, the region has been liberated! Even as our Republic's soldiers enter the streets of the enemy capital, our bureaucrats are already at work implementing Shaposhnikov's post war ideas.

Equally important in the tallying are captured soldiers and surrendering garrisons. It is hoped that many of the men are not very ideological, and can thus be reintegrated into our army.

After a trial to establish his degree of guilt, Krylov shall serve a long sentence in prison where the remnants of his fractured psyche are able to think about the blood he shed in his hunger for power.\n\nOthers, however, hold a more nuanced perspective on the disgraced general. Krylov had long battled depression after the annihilation of the Soviet Union and the death of so many of its people. Sent east to fight for the Central Siberian Republic, his defeat by the anarchist and the treachery of his officers in Krasnoyarsk have sent Krylov's mental health into a final free fall. The faction pleading for clemency, led by Krylov's former friend Marshal Shaposhnikov, have published an open letter requesting Krylov be placed in a mental institution. There, the former mad king might hopefully see his mental health improved, and some of his megalomania removed.\n\nThe debates about this issue have been fierce.

The Marshal of the Republic still made a mental note to insist on better discipline for the guards.\n\nKrylov's room was sparse. A small library held the book on loan to him from Tomsk's libraries. A desk with a simple chair, where the former king received correspondence from his former subjects, and from citizen throughout the Republic. The former missed their king, strangely. The latter were curious about the fallen general. That day, Krylov himself wore an old soviet style uniform, well ironed.\n\nShaposhnikov had visited his old friend once a week, and had occasionally chatted with the hospital's staff. Krylov's delusions of being Rurik's reincarnation were easing away. Only rarely did he give orders to the staff to fetch him food fit for his regal majesty. Shaposhnikov could see the strange mania was draining from the old general's eyes. Only sadness remained. Sadness for the fall of the Soviet Union, sadness for failing the republic before, sadness for failing his new subjects and his children.\n\nKrylov asked about Boris, Lydia and Yuriy. Shaposhnikov would give his old friend any news he had, and offer to carry to them any letter he wanted. Krylov politely declined, saying he didn't feel ready yet to face them. The old general asked about the rest of Central Siberia, and news from the wider world. Whenever Shaposhnikov spoke of such topics, some of the former mad king's energetic expressions returned. The Marshal of the Republic could only hope that his old friend had removed the Mad King's mask, rather than have the Mad King put on Krylov's mannerism.

The mutineers had chosen their location well; upon their betrayal of General Krylov, the rogue military units had seized the city of Krasnoyarsk on the Yenisei river. Recapturing the city would have been a dicey proposition for the failing CSR, forcing an attack upon both sides of the mighty river. The mutineers' hijacking of heavy guns meant to rout the anarchists had ensured that their position was all but unassailable, forcing Krylov to retreat in disgrace. The modern Republican army would be a far better match for Krasnoyarsk. Yet caution remained of the utmost importance.\n\nAfter giving his presentation, and listening to subsequent discussions, Shaposhnikov's thoughts went to Andreev. Personal disdain had no place in a commanding officer's mind. The Marshal of the Republic, however, hated Andreev and his mutineer. Not only had they cost the Republic dearly in blood and treasure, their betrayal had done much to send Krylov into a downward spiral.

After being routed by anarchist rebels, the thought of regrouping for another attempt to subdue the desperate population had broken the soldier's morale. Their act of rebellion against General Krylov had been meant to save Krasnoyarsk and the eastern territories from further bloodshed.\n\nUnfortunately for the mutineers, intercepted transmissions and letters that had predated the mutiny had been saved by fleeing CSR soldiers, and brought back to Tomsk. There, Andreev's duplicity had revealed itself; the coup had been long planned and organized from the top down. Ambitious military officers had lied to their men about Krylov's intentions. Once Krasonyarsk had been captured, a junta had ruled the fallen province, depriving the people of their freedoms.

The room was unsurprisingly tense as the chief Modernist negotiator and his committee sat down across from the presidents and negotiators of the largest unions throughout the nation.\n\nThese discussions would be onerous, as they perfectly encapsulated the great dilemma the government had faced since coming into power: Tomsk needed to industrialize so that the separatists could be reclaimed and Central Siberia could reunify. The workers and unions were demanding better conditions and pay, but if such concessions were made now that might make it impossible for enough goods and munitions to be produced in time to secure Central Siberia, and thus the possibility to protect those workers' rights in the long term.\n\nIn addition to the demands being made by the unions was the pressure being exerted by the Decemberists and the Bastillards, who both more strongly emphasized the long-term solution of focusing on re-conquest. If the Modernists upheld the status quo and refused to make concessions, the other parties would surely increase their support of the government.\n\nUltimately, the primary demand being made by the unions was a reform of Tomsk's collective bargaining system to be fairer and more beneficial to the unionized workers. It was not an altogether unreasonable demand, and conceding to it would no doubt improve stability and workers' rights, but it did run the risk of making Tomsk weaker in a time where it especially needed to be strong.

Krylov's initial push had come close to doing the job. Andreev's betrayal had ensured that there would be no follow up offensives.

The Tomskian offensive, combined with Shaposhnikov's suggested land reforms and food delivery, had done much to peel away communes from the Black Army. The surrender of General Stepanov and his men had rendered the Black Army remnants into a determined insurrection. Tomsk's generals urged their men on, isolating hostile communes and slowly forming a grid of pacified territory within the region.\n\nThe capture of Councilor Krasnopevtev was the Republican army's highest priority, a culmination to the final campaign to eradicate anarchist ideology. The dedicated anarchist ideologue remained defiant to the end, unwilling to accept the offer of amnesty. Krasnopevtev died with his last companions, cornered in a forest safe house in the north. The men and women fought to the last bullet, refusing to grant their Republican foes any legitimacy. The martyrdom of Krasnopevtev echoed through the former free territory, and for a moment it seemed the insurrection might be sparked anew. But as loved as the councillor had been, the communes throughout the region were exhausted by a decade of conflict.\n\nThe Republican army took care to listen to their grievances, and brought food for the poorest. Perhaps their leader would have cast his judgement on them for willingly accepting servitude to the invading state. The peasants hoped the councillor would have found in himself the strength to forgive them.\n\nGeneral Stepanov's trial is due to begin soon. He is expected to argue that he merely wanted to protect local citizens from endless violence, as had all other captured separatists.

Keeping a low profile, Vasilevsky had had the last laugh when his biggest rivals in the Far East and Central Siberia had torn themselves apart. This stay of execution had let the PRC thrive, and the tenacious red Soldiers had clung on to their land, even in the face of the almighty Sphere.\n\nTheir goal was admirable, of helping the mongols fight for their homeland, and of reforging a Soviet Union kinder to its peoples.

Some since the Soviet era." The President replied. His prime minister swirled his cup of tea pensively.\n\n"We can integrate a lot of freedmen into our infrastructure initiatives. Give them apartments in the countryside, near highways and train stations. It will reintegrate them into the nation, and giving them work will save them from destitution."\n\n"Excellent plan.

And keep pressuring the justice departments to process through their backlog. We'll retroactively cancel every wrongly accused citizen's conviction."

They checked him for weapons and then warmly ushered him inside.\n\nThere the sixty years old widower saw the usuals of the teahouse, many of whom sitting around a familiar figure. The famed composer Shostakovich, holding a tea cup in his one good hand, was chatting with the people in a lively fashion. Boris headed to a table and hopefully asked for tea. The owner nodded. Perhaps the electoral candidate had brought some tea with him.\n\nBoris read the newspaper for some time. Eventually some new regulars came in and some went out. Shostakovich limped over to his table, accompanied by Sasha, one of Boris's old friends. The composer asked if he could share a cup of tea with Boris, and Boris nodded.\n\nThe presidential candidate chatted a variety of topics with Sasha and Boris. The conversation flawed awkwardly at time, and naturally at others. A reserved intellectual as he was, the man's warmth and charisma helped lubricate any social friction. Eventually the topic of music came, and Shostakovich asked if Boris possessed any records.\n\n"Only the one, a symphony by Stravinski." Boris replied. The president's eyes lit up. "Can't say I'm a big fan. Ain't no fan of fancy orchestras. The record was my daughter's." The president nodded. Didn't say anything. Boris couldn't help but sigh. The other man was too insightful to inquire about his daughter's fate. "She disappeared east, during the war with Yagoda." Boris concluded. His friend Sasha winced at the topic.\n\nThe composer smiled tightly. "I know she still lives, my friend. When the Republic marches east, you will be freed of Stravinsky's harmonics when we return her the record. Unless by then you've acquired a taste for it?"\n\nBoris smiled sadly. So did Sasha.

The gently melting snow of late winter slushed under the boots of men and women heading out in the open, an open air festival organized by the Decembrist society on the shore of the Tom River from a nearby train station.\n\nLocal peasants, organized by their branch of the Decembrist Salon and monks from a nearby monastery, had already organized a large temporary cabin in which tables, benches and fires could be used. A day of drinking, poetry, praying and political speeches.\n\nPresidential hopeful Dmitry Likhachov welcomed those that arrived. "Thank you for taking the time to come here!" He told the assembled crowd of city folk, engineers, scientists and ordinary workers. "It is certainly a commitment to travel out here on a bright winter day. But sometimes, leaving one's habitual home lets us leave one's habitual thought patterns, yes?"\n\nThe day's events were remarkably convivial. Peasants intermingled with industrial workers and university academics. Songs and traditional poems and plays were enjoyed by all. Each discussed their problems. Few easy solutions came from the conversations, especially once the participant had had their share of alcohol and good food. But the ties that bind, the invisible strings that link one Russian to another were considerably reinforced. As the city folks trudged back to the train station, often supported by their new peasant friends, the prospects of mending the old Central Siberian Republic didn't seem so poor after all."

Two parties principally targeted the urban industrial workers: Sakharov's modernists and Kharms' bastillards.\n\nThe former's art often held beautiful, futuristic designs. Modern gleaming cities under the moonlight, built by workers of the Republic. Another popular design combined two posters posted together. The first depicted a strong father kissing his family goodbye before going to his factory shift, leaving his son to his studies The second poster depicted a Russian cosmonaut flying to the moon, a photo of his father in the space ship's cabin. The Modernists would reform the Republic and bring it to a new age of human progress and ingenuity.\n\nThe Bastillard campaign, in contrast, had a stark, surreal aesthetic. Simple slogans such as "Harder work, greater prosperity, stronger Republic" framed angular figures emerging from giant ironworks. The most often used designs were of a particular martial note. One of the posters showed men of the Republic battling a chimera with industrial tools such as hammers. The great beast's twin lion heads represented the traitor generals Pokryshkin and Andreev; the snake tails stood for the anarchists in the east; the eagle body, for the mad kingdom of General Krylov in Kemerovo. A vote for the Bastillard would be a vote for the destruction of the separatists."

By reforming and expanding our civil service and training them to run Tomsk as smoothly as possible, we will be able to take care of you and everyone else.\n\n"A government is at its best when it employs a meritocratic system to select only the most capable and competent people for civil service. We will allow the average and working people to focus on their own lives while we manage Tomsk and maintain its productivity so that the quality of life of the masses is sustained and then improved.\n\n"The next few years will be the defining moments of our republican experiment. Central Siberia must be reunited and the working people must be placated. There is no guarantee of success. However, our odds can only be hurt if Tomsk falls victim to the spectres of populism, political extremism, or restraint.

He heard it was much harder than anything before it, but he was smart enough to pass. He got through the entrance exam. He could do this. Besides, he couldn't go back home to his village.

He signed where needed and turned the page, reading the instructions.\n\nThis test will determine your skills as a bureaucrat. It has five thirty-minute sections with sixty questions each. There will also be a short break between every two sections or after every hour. The five sections are: The History of Russia and the Republic, Organization/Leadership, Science, Philosophy, as well as General Knowledge such as math and language questions. You may begin when your proctor starts the timer.\n\nThere is a lot to know as a bureaucrat, Vasily noticed. But he had been studying every day since he learned of the job, and he wasn't going to let another test get in the way.

It was even expanding with the new students enrolled, most construction also being funded by the government. The university didn't even have a library before he came.\n\nHowever, university was never free, and he was only enrolled because the government had paid the scholarship for him and many others.

Well loved for his humanitarian work and as a writer of books for children, the eccentric poet had run a fantastic campaign among poor workers and among the elites of the capital.

Domestic and foreign threats had to be dealt with aggressively, if Russian democracy was to live. To this simple end, the Bastillard society had prepared robust economic plans to stimulate civilian and military industry and infrastructure.\n\nWith the day's end, all began to return home.

 ERS.100.desc:0 "On Democracy\n\nDemocracy - true democracy -is the ultimate goal and the ultimate end of the Humanist program. The Humanist seeks a society where every facet of life is entrenched ultimately in the democratic process. The workplace should not be a place of oppression, but a place of inspiration, creativity, and cooperation. To this end, the institution of councils and cooperatives are paramount to the spreading of the Humanist ideal; as society and work becomes more and more democratic, the taint of capital will become lesser and lesser upon our society.\n\nAs the people become more educated, participate further in governance, learn to love each other once more, then the lofty ideals of Socialism may come into practice. This is why the Humanist supports education for all of his fellow man, not simply those fortunate enough to be able to pay. This is why public works and good deeds are of paramount importance. Society will not change for the better if we enforce it upon the people, becoming little better than the tyrants of old.\n\nUtopia will only be achieved when every man, and woman, and child strive together to achieve it. This is why we do not ally ourselves with so called Marxist-Leninists. While Marx surely provides a valuable insight in the deconstruction of Capital and the bringing of Utopia, the cynical devotion of that ideology's adherents, their disbelief in their fellow man, leads to the ruin of democracy and the oppression of the proletariat they so love. It is a tragedy, and one that we must seek to prevent in our own Republic.\n\nThis too applies to the devotees of Anarchism - while the Humanist, his heart full of empathy and love for fellow man - may understand the longing of total freedom that drives men to Anarchy, he must remember that ultimately, such a state of being is only possible when all humanity wills it. Until then, the sad fact is that Anarchy is too easily oppressed by outside forces, too easily corrupted by opportunists and evildoers.\n\nThe Humanist, therefore, must remember that his faith in fellow man must never be eclipsed by his pragmatism - for if it is, he has already lost.\n\n- D.

How does a Polish, Jewish composer who lost his family to the Nazis end up as the heir to one of the main contenders for control over an idealistic, experimental republic in the middle of Siberia? Surely, he had to be something of an idealist himself, steadfast in his convictions and forceful in his desire to improve the lives of others.

At the School, students from all walks of life will study international relations, history, language, and political science, among other fields. The goal is to train a new generation of diplomats, who will represent our nation on the world stage. In addition, they will hopefully be able to spread our Humanist ideals to far-flung countries, creating new political and social bonds that will benefit all mankind. Already, agents of the school are traveling the republic, seeking out prospective students.

Data from previous assessments has been difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons, but according to Baranov (1938), Taliev (1951), and Bychowsky (1961), the Kondoma's populations of freshwater fauna in general has declined since the 1920s, in large part due to pollutants from mining and industrial operations in towns near the river, such as Tashtagol and Kaltan.\n\nDuring our assessments, however, we were able to confirm rebounds in a number of populations, including: Carassius carassius, Acipenser ruthenus, Gobio sibiricus, Leuciscus idus, Cobitis sibirica, Barbatula tomiana, Esox lucius, Coregonus maraenoides, Stenodus nelma, and Cottus altaicus.\n\nIt is likely that the introduction of new environmental regulations and ecological protection measures is in large part responsible for this rebound in populations. In addition, in keeping with observations by Shwarts (1963), our team took note of new and extensive flora growth near the banks of the Kondoma, which is also likely attributable to aforementioned policy changes. It is unknown if fishing by local populations will result in increased pressure on these newly growing fish populations.

Valery was, until very recently, a manager in one of the Republic's coal-mining concerns. The company was in dire straits, however, and they let him go along with the rest of his subdivision. He had spent a few nights pacing around his little room while his wife delivered his child to school and, from then on, proceeded to her own work. Valery loved her with all his heart, but it was unfair to her to bear the burden of factory work - not least because of the low pay.\n\nClamping down on his feeling of shame, Valery pushed the door handle and stepped into the building. The sight of it was dazzling. He had never seen ceilings curve and drop so suddenly. Before him were counters behind which the keepers of this place resided: men and women in sharply-tailored shirts and who worked with tireless energy and joy. Valery sauntered to one of them, an elegant young woman in her early forties, wrinkles barely showing. "Uh," he said, confused.\n\n"How can I help you?" she said, her energy infectious through her smile.\n\n"I want to apply for a job.

It follows the daily goings-on of the town's inhabitants: Boris the foreman, Daria the schoolteacher, Alyona and Artyom the factory workers, and so on. However, Dolina Nochi is much stranger than appearances might initially imply. The serial depicts it as almost existing in a bubble, seemingly free from Russia's divisions and turmoil.

A five-headed dragon is arrested by the local police for committing fraud.

This has made the serial especially controversial, as the show constantly veers between mind-numbing boredom and surreal horror. Some decry it as bizarre and meaningless, while devoted fans gather in cafes to compare notes and share theories.

It was a low-level government bureaucrat. "Good afternoon, sir. The government has begun a program of giving children free toys to help stimulate their development. Are your children home from school? They can come pick a few things they'd like."\n\n"Oh, uh sure. Thank you. Luka, Liuba! Come here, the government is bringing you toys!" Confused but also excited for toys, Vasily's two young kids immediately popped their heads out of the front door and browsed the box of toys being carried by the employee.\n\n"I want that one!" yelled both children at the same time, picking an action figure and picture book respectively.\n\nAfter supper, Vasily and his wife watched the two young children playing with their new presents with glee. They were both totally enamored and absorbed by the toys, so surely this was providing some benefit to their childhoods? This new "Bastillard" political party and "Salon" government was awfully strange, but it seemed they cared about making life bearable for their citizens. They couldn't be too bad."
 ERS.140.a:0 "Luka and Liuba especially seem to like the new government."

 ERS.141.desc:0 ""There is no other choice. You make use of the opportunities that exist, or you fail to survive. I would be interested in hearing alternative plans for our development, but I already know you have none."\n\nKharms's dry, stinging words hung briefly over the deputies in the parliament before a deafening rabble consumed the entire room. Jeers and boos came from all over, including from some especially opinionated Bastillards, until Kharms yelled "ENOUGH!" over all the noise. It was incredibly rare that he got even a little flustered. Instantly calming down, the president continued,\n\n"I am no fan of the policies of the Empire of Japan myself. But it would be a grave mistake to ignore the massive economic boon we would experience by opening trade links with them. All we need to do is build up Manchurian industry and expand our Pacific ports, and our republic will have an economy that eventually eclipses even that of Germany. It is impossible to act in a morally pure fashion at every single crossroads, and we have an obligation to ensure that we spread democracy and prosperity as far and wide as we can. We need to finish this project to do that. And besides, you don't think Japan will find someone else to trade with if we don't trade with them? You are not that naive."\n\nThe parliament was much quieter than before. The deputies heavily pondered what their president had said, but whether Kharms's grand eastern development project came fully to fruition was still up in the air."
 ERS.141.a:0 "Will the plan be realized?"

 ERS.142.desc:0 "Every last fascist party member and sympathizer is being located and put through "De-Harbinization" trials at this very moment. Mandatory classes are being taught to more moderate people on the evils and lack of freedom brought by fascism and monarchism. Every last vestige of authoritarian tendency will be wiped off the face of the Far East, even if we have to use rather... authoritarian means.\n\nSome of the most radical among the local populace are even being forcibly sent to re-education camps, and many people are being put on government lists, but these extreme circumstances mean we must reluctantly resort to these extreme measures. It is sad that we have no choice but to violate some of our principles, but it is absolutely necessary for the safety, stability, and eventual prosperity of our republic."
 ERS.142.a:0 "A bit of a paradox."

 ERS.143.desc:0 "Shaposhnikov and Likhachyov watched from afar as the parade of oddly-clad and heavily armed soldiers marched along one of Tomsk's main roads. Their colourful, neo-Napoleonic uniforms really were odd, but they certainly stood out. "Those are some impressive weapons we have in our arsenal," commented Likhachyov, gesturing towards some modern tanks and self-propelled artillery pieces.\n\n"Yes," replied Shaposhnikov, "but these are easily the best-equipped men in the entire army. There is still very much work ahead before we are ready for any major conflict."\n\n"That's good to know, General. But at the very least, the people will be reassured of our strength and glad to see the men who fight for our republic up close."\n\n"There is definitely value in that, Mr. President.""

 ERS.144.t:0 "The Great Discord Speech" #Tomsk event decembrist superreg The Great Discord Speech
 ERS.144.desc:0 ""There is a great discord in our republic. A political turmoil which has constantly threatened the very existence of this nation and our unique form of governance for years, since long before we even reunited the old territories of the Central Siberian Republic. Every single person here knows exactly what I am referring to: our Salon system is utterly incapable of dealing with outsiders.\n\n"Disunity is plaguing us, it's slowly killing us like the venom of a snake, but we're simply ignoring it and allowing the lifeblood of the country to slowly drain out of it. So many care nothing for what our government does, or have lost faith in us ages ago. So many more still wish to belong to some other rival state because their ideology is so much better than ours or they miss their dear leader. This is a severe problem! But it is not impossible to solve.\n\n"We can integrate people from all circles into our system; the independents, the majority of the radicals, the cynics, the siloviki, just about all of them! But some of us are scared to place their power in jeopardy. This is about the good of the republic, not your desire to keep your seat in the chamber. Start acting like it."I have a great many plans to put an end to this great discord, but we need everyone fully committed and working harder than ever. Maintaining the legacy of Pasternak so that it stands forever across Russia is far from easy. Let's get our hands dirty and get to work.""

 ERS.145.desc:0 ""Mister Rostow," said Gergory Sviridov, "thank you so much for meeting with me. Although I am a composer, my government has taken me with trying to find support here for our claim on Russia."\n\n"You shouldn't have any problem with that," said Walt Whitman Rostow, one of the more prominent figures in the American National Progressive Party. "There's a bunch of people here who would wish to see Russia united under a strong, democratic government such as yours. That's honestly the best case scenario for the United States. And plenty of politicians will gladly support you."\n\nSviridov was intrigued. "Do you know anyone specifically who could be of any aid?"\n\nWalt took out a pen and a scrap of paper. "There's two major ones I know," he said. "Scoop Jackson, that's the one you want to see. He's the big NPP foreign policy guy. He'll support you, you folks fit his qualifications. You like freedom, democracy, capitalism, and you aren't making any bones about giving Fritz one to the nuts."\n\n"Very good, Mister Rostow."\n\n"Now for the R-Ds, there's a guy who will for sure want to be your friend. Name's George McGovern. Have a talk with him, and you'll get along just fine if you want good relations with America. He'll give you some more R-Ds who will want to be your friend as well. And if you have any food problems, he'll want to help you on that.""
